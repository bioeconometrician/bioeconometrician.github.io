<br>

Chapters: Cairo, Istanbul, Tehran, Vortex, Nation, and Counter-Enlightenment 

> After barely an hour the enemy was routed in an engagement which Napoleon christened the Battle of the Pyramids, whose mysterious forms could be made out through the haze, even if the majority of the French had no idea what they were. The causaulty figures--around one thousand Mamluks dead to twenty-nine Frenchmen--spoke of a hideous imbalance of tactics, traning, and quipment, and Sheikh Jabarti contrasted the efficiency of the infidel with the woeful defenders, who were 'at odds with each other, envious, fearful for their lives and their comforts, immersed in ignorance and self-delusion, arrogant and haighty in their attire and presumptuousness'. The result of the battle, furthermore, did not simply reflect the qualities of hte two sides. A medieval Eastern army was anihlated by a modern Western one and a proud Islamic capital - Al-Qahira, 'the victorious' -- was lost to the infidel.
