### Book #1: The Glass Hotel by Emily St. John Mandel

<br>

<br>

> Paul had the impression he often had in the United Kingdom, of just having been subtly insulted in an obscure way that would take too much energy to parse, and as always he couldn't tell whether the insult was real or just a typically Canadian case of postcolonial insecurity. 

<br>


### Book #2: Trade by Lapham's Quarterly

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/lq_trade.jpg" width="13%"></p>
<br>

Modern trade is seen as villanous (Conrad's Leyroyd banker fellow), trade historically (unless its the transatlantic slave trade) is seen as romantic. Reminds me of the comparison of Europeans being okay with Knights but horrified about 20th century warfare.

The articles seem to miss a lot of the nuances about the division of labour and comparative advantage.

### Book #3: The Girl with the Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier

<br>

### Book #4: The Fisherman by Chigozi Obioma 

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/the_fishermen.jpg" width="13%"></p>
<br>

### Book #5: The Radetzky March by Joseph Roth

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/radetzky_march.jpg" width="13%"></p>
<br>

The introduction quotes Robert Musil, that "One can't be angry with one's own time without damage to oneself". 

> Unruffled and sprightly, he got off the footboard with that "elastic step" that the newspapers always ascribed to the old Kaiser and that many elderly government officials had gradually mastered. For in those days people in the monarchy had a very distinctive and now completely forgotten way of leaving trains and carriages, entering restaurants, mounting perrons, stepping into houses, and approaching friend and relatives: it was a way of walking that may have been partly dictated by the snug trousers of the elderly gentlemen and by the rubber straps with which many of them fastened their trousers to their boots. 



### Book #6: The Heart of the Matter by Graham Greene

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/heart_of_the_matter.jpg" width="13%"></p>
<br>

### Book #7: Heart of Darkness & Other Stories by Joseph Conrad 

<br>

<br>

> They grabbed what they could get for the sake of what was to be got. It was just robbery with violence, aggravated murder on a great scale, and men going at it blind -- as is very proper for those who tackle a darkness. The conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves, is not a pretty thing when you look into it too much.

> In a world that pared down the profits to an irreducible minimum, in a world that was able to count its disengaged tonnage twice over every day, and in which lean charters were snapped up by cable three months in advance, there were no chances of fortune for an individual wandering haphazard with a little barque - hardly indeed any room to exist. 

> What to the other parties was merely the sale of a ship was to him a momentous event involving a radically new view of existence. He knew that after this ship there would be no other; and the hopes of his youth, the exercise of his abilities, every feeling and achievement of his manhood, had been indissolubly connected with ships. He had served ships; he had owned ships; and even the years of his actual retirement from the sea had been made bearable by the idea that he had only to stretch out his hand full of money to get a ship. He had been at liberty to feel as though he were the owner of all the ships in the world. The selling of this one was weary work; but when she passed from him at last, when he signed the last receipt, it was as though all the ships had gone out of the world together, leaving him on the shore of inaccessible oceans with seven hundred pounds in his hands. 

> He had been his own employer too long. The only credential he could produce was the testimony of his whole life. What better recommendation could anyone require? But vaguely he felt that the unique document would be looked upon as an archaic curiosity of the Eastern waters, a screed traced in obsolete words -- in a half-forgotten language.
