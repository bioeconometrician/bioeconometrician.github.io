### Book #2: Trade by Lapham's Quarterly

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/.jpg" width="13%"></p>
<br>

Modern trade is seen as villanous (Conrad's Leyroyd banker fellow), trade historically (unless its the transatlantic slave trade) is seen as romantic. Reminds me of the comparison of Europeans being okay with Knights but horrified about 20th century warfare.

The articles seem to miss a lot of the nuances about the division of labour and comparative advantage.
