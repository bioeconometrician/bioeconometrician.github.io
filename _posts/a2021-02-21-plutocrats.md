### Introduction

As someone who has to frequently change which projects they are working on, I am often in sympathy with (The Honourable) Chrystia Freeland who is continually given more and more portfolios in the Trudeau government. Anything that is considered "mission critical" gets put into her hands: dealing with [Western alienation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_alienation), finalizing the [USMCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States%E2%80%93Mexico%E2%80%93Canada_Agreement), being the deputy prime minister, and (when she has free time) coordinating the government's response to COVID-19. Many Canadians are probably not aware that the now Minister of Finance was once a business journalist for the likes of the *Financial Times*, Reuters, and *The Globe and Mail*. *Plutocrats*, published in 2012, is Freeland's second (and most recent) book. A year after the book was published she won a by-election in [Toronto Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Centre) with the Liberal Party. 

The central hypothesis of *Plutocrats* is that an outsize share of global wealth and income creation has gone to a new global elites: 21st century plutocrats who have more in common with each other than they do with their fellow countrymen. These individuals go to a handful of elite schools, work at a handful of elite firms, visit the same conferences, and see themselves as "global" citizens. Unlike the elites of the *ancien regime*, today's super-rich do not derive their wealth from land or inherited wealth but rather a hybrid "worker-capitalist" model. These are the Russian oligarchs who bought up assets on the cheap and transformed their companies into globally-focused commodity exports or hedge-fund managers like [Steve Schwarzman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Schwarzman) who regularly take home salaries in excess of $100 million. Pointing out that today's plutocrats are qualitatively different is not a new idea. I have come across similar ideas in other books like Piketty's [*Capital*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Century) which was published in 2014 or Alain De Botton's *Status Anxiety* or the *The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work*. 



### Forces beyond our control?

At various point in the book, Freeland makes it clear that some of the gains of the super rich is ill-gotten from either rent seeking or political capture. For example, many Russian oligarchs got rich by obtaining state assets at fire-sale prices. The amount of value-added that actually goes into resources extraction is often limited. However, Freeland also reviews other structural theories as to why the rich have gotten richer:

1. [Sherwin Rosen effect](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1803469?seq=1)
2. [Marshall effect](https://www.econlib.org/library/Marshall/marP.html?chapter_num=55#book-reader)
3. Roger Martin effect
4. [Matthew Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect)

The Rosen effect is based on two premises. First, there is a imperfect substitution whereby small improvements in quality receives a large increase in demand (think of a great versus a good surgeon). Second, there is a superstar effect which is based on technology that scales a worker's effort almost costlessly (it is just as difficult to record a podcast for 10 listeners as it is for 10 million). The Rosen effect certainly describes some sets of labour market positions, especially when the number of roles does not scale with the population. The Rosen effect clearly captures the dynamics of some areas of elite labour market very well, like professional sports. For example, the number of elite tennis players has roughly remained constant, so that the top stars receive the overwhelming number of "eyeballs on the screen" (imperfect substitution). Because broadcasting a tennis match costs the same regardless of the number of viewers, the superstar effect is dominant. As [Kruger's classic study noted](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/425431?seq=1): the MTV-era further concentrated the superstar effects of radio: between 1982 to 2003 share of concert revenue taken by top 5 percent of performers went from 62 to 84%, while the top 1 percent went from 26-53%.

The Marshall effect was noted by the [famous economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Marshall) almost 100 years before Rosen's article was published. In the chapter the "General Influences of Economic Progress" he wrote:

> The relative fall in the incomes to be earned by moderate ability, however carefully trained, is accentuated by the rise in those that are obtained by many men of extraordinary ability. There never was a time at which moderately good oil paintings sold more cheaply than now, and there never was a time at which first-rate paintings sold so dearly. A business man of average ability and average good fortune gets now a lower rate of profits on his capital than at any previous time; while yet the operations, in which a man exceptionally favoured by genius and good luck can take part, are so extensive as to enable him to amass a huge fortune with a rapidity hitherto unknown.
>
> The causes of this change are chiefly two; firstly, the general growth of wealth; and secondly, the development of new facilities for communication, by which men, who have once attained a commanding position, are enabled to apply their constructive or speculative genius to undertakings vaster, and extending over a wider area, than ever before.
>
> It is the first cause, almost alone, that enables some barristers to command very high fees; for a rich client whose reputation, or fortune, or both, are at stake will scarcely count any price too high to secure the services of the best man he can get: and it is this again that enables jockeys and painters and musicians of exceptional ability to get very high prices. In all these occupations the highest incomes earned in our own generation are the highest that the world has yet seen. But so long as the number of persons who can be reached by a human voice is strictly limited, it is not very likely that any singer will make an advance on the Â£10,000, said to have been earned in a season by Mrs Billington at the beginning of last century, nearly as great as that which the business leaders of the present generation have made on those of the last.

What Marshall wrote reads true today. If one reads the whole chapter, Marshall foreshadows [The Race Between Education and Technology](The Race between Education and Technology) and Skill-Biased Technological Change. The third structural factor in today's "working rich" is the [(Roger) Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Martin_(professor)) Effect, in which capital is in competition with talent, rather than labour per se, in the digital economy. For example, the bottlenecks a high-tech company like Google faces is being able to hire enough skilled engineers to meet a business expansion. Whereas raising sufficiently cheap capital is trivial. In the era of the [Robber barons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robber_baron_(industrialist)) by contrast, capital was the limiting factor the railway or telegraph companies that needed huge sums of money to build their infrastructure. Even the halcyon post-WWII era, exchange controls and financial repression were necessary due to a scarcity of capital.

While the first three theories are all natural in the sense that they represent structural changes to the market, the Matthew Effect is arguably the closest to the problem of political economy: the rich tend to get richer through entrenched privileges. The mechanism of inter-generational elite preservation needn't rely on the political system *per se*, and could instead be driven by higher levels of human capital investment, for example. However, it is reasonable to assume that both private action and state capture have helped to reduce income mobility over time. Distinguishing "natural" or "technological" forces from those of public policy may be useful in understanding their origin, but I am sceptical in endorsing the former as inevitable or somehow more legitimate. As an institutionalist, I ultimately believe that economics follows politics, rather than the other way around. 

To provide an example of how these effects can be dominated by history, culture, and politics consider the Manhattan Project. There were truly only a handful of men at the time with sufficient knowledge of nuclear physics to be able to develop atomic weaponry; men like Robert Oppenheimer and Enrico Fermi (imperfect substitutes if there ever was). And yet, these scientists saw their labour no differently from the GIs storming the beaches at Normandy: a duty. The human effort from the common man and woman that went into fighting the second world war easily exceeded the tenacity of Sheryl Sandberg's leaning in. Or think of the intellectual founders of the computer age like Vannevar Bush or Alan Turing. These pioneers hardly extracted a pittance of the social value of the technology they created. One could argue that the public-spiritedness was bound to be defeated by the desire for commercialization (which it was), but it required a shift a shift in the cultural ethos that had otherwise remained unchanged for decades.

### Good billionaires, bad billionaires

GOOD VS BAD BILLIONAIRES: Carlos Slim and the Russian Oligarchs

Yet this deserving billionaires perspective misses something broader. Consider the case of China, which has been [minting billionaires](https://qz.com/1919974/china-created-a-record-number-of-billionaires-despite-covid-19/) at a remarkable rate since 1999. It is universally agreed that Chinese billionaires are allowed to keep their wealth only by the grace of the Chinese Communist Party (see the case of [Jack Ma](https://www.ft.com/content/3d2f174d-aa73-44fc-8c90-45c2a554e97b)): "China's plutocrats don't fight the state because they are the state." Yet as *Plutocrats* points out, between 2003 to 2011, at least fourteen Chinese billionaire businessmen were executed. Having billionaires derive their gains from political connections is "bad". Yet as the writer Nassim Taleb has repeatedly pointed out that criticizing Donald Trump for going bankrupt was a foolish political strategy because most citizens respect wealthy individuals who have both upside and downside risk. For most of the political, media, and academic elites, the goal in life is accumulate stable financial assets and index-linked pensions. They are baffled why anyone would want leverage themselves to the point of bankruptcy. Yet just as the King who leads his troops into battle earns more respect from soldiers, one must admit a grudging respect for the Chinese billionaires who live with the Sword of Damocles over their heads. Freeland does not discuss the value in having downwards, as well as upwards mobility. 

By definition, to have (relative) upwards mobility, there has to be a corresponding degree of downwards mobility. If we are interested in undoing the Matthew effect, it is worth considering how many of today's elites are likely to be bankrupt in a generation's time.

MAKES REFERNECE TO VENICE



### Wealth at the top of the pyramid

The Citigroup analysis is overblown, what about the wealth at the bottom of the pyramid?

> In a plutonomy there is no such animal as 'the US consumer' or 'the UK consumer' or indeed the 'the Russian consumer.' There are rich consumers, few in number but disproportionate in the gigantic slice of income and consumption they take. There are the rest, the non-rich, the multitudinous many, but only accounting for surprisingly small bites of the national pie. 

This is consumer hourglass theory, see Citigroup's Hourglass Index. But even though the index has performed well, the question is whether it will beat expectations going forward (i.e. we already know inequality is getting worse). 

Smith features prominently in the book. Lots of good quotes:

> The proprietor of land is necessarily a citizen of the particular country in which his estate lies. The proprietor of stock is necessarily a citizen of the world, and is not necessarily attached to any particular country. He would be apt to abandon the country in which he was exposed to a vexatious inquisition, in order to be assessed to a burdensome tax, and would remove his stock to some other country where he could either carry on his business, or enjoy his fortune more at his ease.


### O Canada

Lots of fun drama about the debate between Mark Carney and Blankfein. Contrasts regulatory race to the bottom of London and New York with Canada's sober perspective.

LITTLE MENTION OF POLICIES THAT STOP THE PLUTOCRACY. AND WHAT HAVE THE LIBERALS DONE IN OFFICE? DEFENDED NAFTA AND CETA! 

The Liberal [platform](https://liberal.ca/our-platform/a-responsible-fiscal-plan/) is a joke: "reviewing"  government spending and tax expenditures to find ways the wealthy benefit from unfair tax breaks, taxing "multinational" companies and specifically "multinational tech giants", and taxing foreign real estate speculators. Of course, the best way to find rising domestic income inequality is to tax foreigners. But don't worry, there will be a "new 10 per cent tax on luxury cars, boats, and personal aircraft over $100,000." Whenever a government promises to review something, you know its main purpose is to academics sympathetic to your party to publish a report no one will read let alone act on.
