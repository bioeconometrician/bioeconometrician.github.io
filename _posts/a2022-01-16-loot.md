Most of the book purchase requests I submit to my local library system are politely declined. There just is not enough room on the stacks for a [monetary history of China](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300250046/empire-silver) in a medium-sized Ontario city, alas. I was therefore pleasantly surprised when my request for *Loot: Britain and the Benin Bronzes* by [Barnaby Phillips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnaby_Phillips) went through. As the title suggests, this book is both a history and contemporary reflection on the great works of West African sculpture, known as the Benin Bronzes, that were stolen from the [Kingdom of Benin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Benin) during an [1897 punitive expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin_Expedition_of_1897). What was a small chapter in British colonial history has been the defining event for the [Edo people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_people) in Nigeria for the last 125 years. As English-speaking societies continue to go through a "Great Awokening," books like *Loot* provide a useful background in understanding the motivations driving the decolonization and anti-racism movements. 

The [Benin Bronzes](https://www.gettyimages.ca/photos/benin-bronze) are objectively beautiful pieces of art. Similar to the [Elgin Marble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elgin_Marbles) friezes, they depict a variety of heroic and regal characters with almost classical-like proportions. Unfortunately the Bronzes are barely known outside of Nigeria and the art world. Yet this is changing. Demands for decolonization and art restitution are putting the Bronzes, are other pieces of [ethnographic art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_art), in the spotlight in a way they have never been before. Why do the great works of art of the Edo people live in London and Berlin? And why do European artists like [Damien Hirst](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/arts/design/damien-hirst-controversy-at-venice-biennale.html) get the blatantly plagiarize the Bronzes without apportioning due credit?

The Benin Bronzes were produced over a 600 year period, dating from creation of [*Igun Eromwon*](https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ijah/article/view/152306) (The Guild of Bronze Casters) by the Oba Oguola in 1280AD until the destruction of Benin City in 1897. Metallurgy has a long and proud tradition in West Africa, most famously the [blacksmiths of Kano](https://eprints.soas.ac.uk/29100/1/10731195.pdf). Debates still continue as to the origin of the Benin Kingdom and its casting tradition. Claims that the Kingdom of Benin were founded by the offspring of the [Ooni of Ife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If%E1%BA%B9#The_King_(Ooni_of_Ile-Ife)) are [politically contentious](https://guardian.ng/issue/the-ooni-of-ife-conflict-of-modernity-and-tradition/). When the Portuguese arrived in the 15th century, the Kingdom of Benin had already absorbed many of its neighbours and Oba lived in a substantial palace within a walled city. The Portuguese presence to the Oba proved to be a boon, both militarily and artistically. A single Portuguese ship could carry thousands of [manillas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manilla_(money)) which could be melted down for copper, bronze, and brass. The *Igun Eromwon* now had a surfeit of material to work with. In exchange for slaves, the Benin would use the fearsome weaponry of the Europeans to subdue their enemies and expand their influence. 

The theft and subsequent restitution of art is hardly a new phenomenon in world affairs. [Islamic military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_military_jurisprudence) law dictated (in theological theory) what could and could not be looted after a siege. After Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, the forces of the Seventh Coalitions collected most of the artwork that Napoleon's *Grande ArmÃ©e* had stolen and returned it to their countries of origin. As Duke of Wellington [wrote to Lord Castlereagh](http://www.brunacci.it/upl/1815,%2020%20ott.pdf) in 1815:

> They would desire to retain these works of art, not because Paris is the properest place them to be preserved in ... but because they have been acquired by conquests of which they are trophies. The same feeling that makes the people of France wish to keep the pictures and statures of other nations, must naturally make other nations, now that victory is on their side, to restore those articles to their lawful owners; and the Allied Sovereigns must feel a desire to promote this object... **In my opinion, it would not only be unjust in the Sovereigns to gratify the French people, but the sacrifice they would make would be impolitic, and it would deprive them of the opportunity of giving the French a great moral lesson.**

<!-- (for all artists and connoisseurs who have written on the subject agree that they ought to be sent back to the place where they originally were),
It is besides to be wished, as well for the happiness of France as of the world, that if the French people are not greatly convinced that Europe is too strong for them, they may be made to feel, that however extensive for a time their temporary and partial advantages over one or more of the Powers of Europe may be, the day of retribution must at length come. -->

In early 1897 the acting Consul General of Niger Coast Protectorate, James Robert Phillips, made an unauthorized expedition to Kingdom of Benin to demand the resignation of Oba Ovonramwen. The plan was to have a native council of indigenous elites friendly to British interests step in for the Oba. Two months before, Phillips had sent the Foreign Office a message explaining his rationale for regime change. But he grew tired of waiting for a response and decided to launch the expedition on his authority alone. While the Oba's motivations are not fully known, it is clear that he or some powerful members of his court power perceived (correctly) that Phillips was an existential threat to Kingdom. Phillips' small band of Europeans (less than a dozen) and hundreds of African porters was ambushed on the way and slaughtered. The two Europeans who did escape miraculously managed to make it down the Ughoton Creek to safety. 

Within a week of his Phillips death it was decided that a punitive expedition would be sent to remove the Oba and destroy his Kingdom. Overnight Phillips had gone from a liability of the Foreign Office to a martyr of British Enlightenment values. By February 9th the British had landed troops in Nigeria and by the 18th they had captured the capitol. When the British marched into Benin City in 1897, the rules that governed "civilized warfare" were not in application. Should this be considered ironic given the British cultural insistence of "fair play" and the common law's veneration of property rights? Never underestimate the Victorian idea to compartmentalize. As Phillips notes in the book, even in the private memoirs written years later of British officers who nicked dozens of Bronzes, there was almost no hint of guilt or moral doubt. To the Victorian officer, the Oba was a petty tyrant who engaged in barbarous practices like human sacrifice. His Kingdom still maintained a system of slavery and "fetish" worship which was an obstruction to human progress. It could hardly be considered a great loss that beautiful relics, perhaps even made by the Portuguese, should be returned to England where they would be far more appreciated. 

Perhaps the even bigger blow to the Edo people from the punitive Benin Expedition was the destruction of their city from a tremendous fire. Although many Edo people believe the British deliberatively destroyed the city, the documentary record indicates that the British high command, at least, saw the fire as an unfortunate and unplanned event. Not for the human cost of course, but because much loot was lost in the conflagration. Most of the art in the Oba's palace was part of shrines or installations. The destruction of the physical building meant that the looted Bronzes and ivory art pieces would live forever unmoored to their spiritual and cultural origins. The Edo people would also loose forever a chance of a documentary record as to how the art was displayed in its original setting. 

Although loot was considered fair game when taken from "primitive" peoples, there were some Europeans who expressed concern at their armies' artistic pillaging. After the British [destroyed Maqdala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Magdala) in 1868 and looted many of its treasures, Prime Minister Gladstone [expressed consternation](https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1871/jun/30/motion-for-an-address) several years later:

> He (Mr. Gladstone) deeply regretted that those articles were over brought from Abyssinia, and could not conceive why they were so brought. They were never at war with the people or the churches of Abyssinia. They were at war with Theodore, who personally had inflicted on them an outrage and a wrong; and he deeply lamented, for the sake of the country, and for the sake of all concerned, that those articles, to us insignificant, though probably to the Abyssinians sacred and imposing symbols, or at least hallowed by association, were thought fit to be brought away by a British Army. 

In September 1897 the British Museum held an exhibition in celebration of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. The Museum and its curators were prescient in purchasing as many Bronzes as possible from returning officers. Spectators who the African sculptures were amazed as the castings which resembled "the finest bronzes of the fifteen and sixteenth centuries in Europe." Because Africans were considered to be genetically inferior and without history, the presence of the Bronzes implied that either the Edo people had not made them or that African historiography was need in of revision. The "problem of the origin and meaning of the Benin Bronzes" was one for Europe not for Benin to solve. For Felix von Luschan of the Ethnological Museum in Berlin the Bronzes were "purely African, thoroughly and exclusively of and out African." He was shocked that the British treated the castings as little more than war booty. At the time the Bronzes were considered little more than curios whilst the ivory stolen from the palace was the commodity of true value. In his more enlightened moments, Luschan even though that "the culture of the so called 'savages' is not inferior to our own, only different."

Even if the Bronzes did not cause an immediate paradigm shift, they did at least present a observational counterpoint to European superiority. In the early 20th century artistic elites like Picasso and Gauguin developed a new art movement: [*Primitivism*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitivism). Inspired by art from Africa and Oceania, this movement used the exoticism of primitive cultures as a mechanism to explore more abstract and conceptual art pieces. Picasso's [*Les Demoiselles d'Avignon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Demoiselles_d%27Avignon) has mask-like faces redolent of the Bronzes themselves. The Bronzes were a small contribution to this broader shift of artistic sensibilities in Europe.

## Restitution

Yet claims for restitution of the artworks by the Edo people are more nuanced than one may have expected. As part of the book, Barnaby Phillips talks to a wide range Nigerians including the ... Wrapped up in this discussion is Nigeria's relationship with its British history. Most Nigerian politicians and public figures will express the view that colonialism was an unalloyed disaster for the country. Responsible for most, if not all, of the country's problems. In private, views are more circumspect. Even 	



> For Benin, the British invasion will always represent the moment ... the 'world turned upside down'. For Britain it was another small campaign against a primitive tribe on the frontier of Empire, of little consequence after the brief thrill of victory. It's perhaps not surprising that the children of those who toppled the Oba and took his treasure should have been oblivious to those events. The winners get to write history. Often that means forgetting its less convenient chapters.
