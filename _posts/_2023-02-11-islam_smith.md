## Background thoughts

The enduring legacy of the transatlantic slave in the New World is hard to overstate. The extractive economic systems developed around slavery help to explain much of the economic variations we see from the relative poverty of the American South, to economic underdevelopment of the Caribbean economies, to the chronic instability of the Brazilian economy.[[^1]] Chattel slavery is horrific for the humans involved, and ironically corrodes the development capabilities of all citizens -- slaves or not. Put another way, by converting humans into capital, chattel slavery ultimately undermines the human capital of the slave-owning portion of society (to say nothing of the slaves or their descendants). Thus, the places in the world that were historically able to move away from slavery the fastest were those that were able to capitalize on technologically-driven economic growth that has been responsible for increases in human well-being since the Industrial Revolution.

Slavery is a complicated concept of course. Marxists were quick to point out that the "wage slavery" made the bulk of humanity completely dependent of the owners of capital for their sustenance, creating a dependency that suggests a worker were little different than a slave. This is course specious, since at a minimum, an actual slave works under a 100% marginal tax rate. More obviously, no sane worker, even in the slums of Dickensian London, would have swapped their lot with a chattel slave working under the whip of a plantation hand. The point that is worth acknowledging though, is that the model of a chattel slave producing an export crop is not the only model of coerced labour. To this day, many describe the type of brutal work arrangements employed by the Gulf States as a form of slavery, especially with the most recent [FIFA 2022 World Cup](https://www.glimpsefromtheglobe.com/topics/human-security/modern-day-slavery-behind-the-2022-fifa-world-cup/). Though repugnant in all its forms, there are important distinctions in the types of slavery that have been practised throughout human history, from the chattel slavery of the world, to the concubinage of the Islamic world.

## Book review

In William Gervase Clarence-Smith's *Islam and the Abolition of Slavery*, the author provides a historical overview of how slavery was practised in the Islamic world, and how it was gradually abolished. By the author's own admission, this is an area of research that has been understudied, both because of a relative disinterest by Western scholars, but also because of pervasive denialism that, to this day, still pervades the Islamic world. While the defining moments of slavery's decline in the "Western" world all date to the 19th century and before,[[^2]] the Islamic world continued to pass laws well into the 20th century that sought to restrict slavery. Given the limited state capacity of most Muslim-majority countries it is fair to assume that practice persisted much longer than that. For example, slaves in Kano were still receiving facial scars indicating their position in life into the 1950s.[[^3]]

Slavery is mentioned throughout the Old and New Testaments. While modern exegesis would point to the emancipatory nature of the text, there are no plain-reading outright denunciations of slavery in the Judeo-Christian canon.[[^4]] In fact, two of the Pauline books of the New Testament commands slaves to obey their masters.[[^5]] That being said, none of the Jewish prophets or Jesus himself owned slaves. One of the theses of Clarence-Smith is that while Christianity was late to the idea of universal abolition,[[^6]] but embraced it much faster and with much more fervour than Islam has, and ever did. Put another way, there has been no mass social or cultural movement within the Islamic world that resembles the [abolitionist movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism) of 18th century England or the 19th century United States. 

In his first chapter, *The Embarrassing Institution*, Clarence-Smith points out that even slavery approached its *dÃ©nouement* in the Western world, it was picking up steam in the Islamic.

> During the Egyptian cotton boom of 1860s and 1870s, triggered by the Civil War in the United States, even modest Egyptian peasant bought slaves... while Circassian concubines became status symbols. Anatolian agrarian prosperity rested to some extent of Blank and Circassian field saves, and there was scarcely an Iraqi family of middling Muslim household in India without a slave. 
> 
> 'Smallholder slavery' was generally most intense on the Islamic frontier. The upsurge in exports of of pepper from North Sumatra depended on a mix of slaves and other workers. Many Oromo in the Ethiopian kingdom of Jimma owned 'one of two' slaves, freeing owners to market coffee. In the Gambia in 1869, where groundnut exports were expanding, 'as soon as each has been able to purchase a horse and a gun, he considers himself a warrior, lives by plunder and woks his fields by the slaves he captures in his expeditions, and thinks it beneath his dignity to perform any work whatsoever, which is left to women and slaves'. 


The arguments in favour of Islamic slave holders closely mimicked those of the Europeans: i) slavery provided the opportunity for conversation (and therefore salvation), and ii) the slaves themselves were genetically pre-disposed to the nature of the work. For example, Fulani nobles from [Futa Jalon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fouta_Djallon) declared that: "God imposed work on our father Adam, but he made pagans, with thick skills and strong arms, good only for working the land, and clearly destined to serve believers."

## The numerical scale

Modern scholarship puts the number of number of captured slaves at [12 million](https://www.slavevoyages.org/voyage/database) that were part of the transatlantic slave trade over a 400 year period. Estimating the equivalent number of slaves that were part of the Islamic slave trade is harder to estimate given the longer duration (Muhammed died 1400 years ago), and the paucity of written records. Nevertheless, scholars like Ralph Austen have estimated that 17 million black African slaves crossed either the Sahara, the Red Sea, or the Indian ocean. Others, like Paul Lovejoy estimated an equivalent figure of 11.5 million. That figure does not include the slaves there were retained locally within Africa, or European slaves captured by Islamic pirates. For example, one of the United States first overseas wars against the [Barbary pirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Barbary_War). Over 1 million European slaves were brought to North Africa from the 1500s to the 1800s. The Ottoman empire itself was a profligate user of slaves. Muslim Crimean Tartars enslaved almost 2 million Ukranains, Poles, and Russians over 300 years, and 2.5 million [Circassians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circassians) were captured from the 1450s. The infamous [*devshirme*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devshirme) system took Christians from the Balkans as a form of military conscription and conversion. 

All this is to say, that the historic quantities of slaves taken by Islamic societies vastly exceed the numerical quantity of the transatlantic slave trade.

## Conclusion

A causal connection between religious scripture and social practice is difficult to provide, both because of the impossibility of providing the connection between profession and true belief, and also because of the vast number of contradictions within religious texts and their interpreters. That being said, the handful of societies that continue X. That being said, there is almost certainly more in common within a Muslim community in Long Beach California and its evangelical counterpart. Rather, it points to a lasting legacy of beliefs within Islam that have yet to be universally expunged.

[^1]: The American South is richer than most other regions in the Americans, but poor relative to other States within the Union. The Bahamas is an exception to this in the Caribbean, but the average income of the Bahamas is solely a function of its ability to attract money by being a tax haven, which makes its economic value add purely one of arbitrage that is almost certainly a net-negative for the global economy as whole. Brazil was the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery in 1888.
