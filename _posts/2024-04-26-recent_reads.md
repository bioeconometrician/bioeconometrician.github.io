### Background


### Review

The Enlightment begins with Napoleon crushing the Egyptian Mamluks in the Battle of the Pyramids. Reform was fought at every step: the introduction of modern medicine and autopsy was initially seen as haram. 

Chapters: Cairo, Istanbul, Tehran, Vortex, Nation, and Counter-Enlightenment 

I would give the book a score of 8/10, but could imagine a higher variance in assessments given the book's political implications and subject matter. 

Constitutional reforms: Tanzimat reforms, Iran 1905...
the end of male concubinage 

Dictators: Muhammad Ali Pasha, Nasser al-Din Shah, Mirza Reza Kermani I, Abbas Mirza
Agitators/thinkers: Amir Kabir (Iran), Abdulrahman al-Jabarti (chronciler), Banna (Muslim brotherhood), Jamal al-Din Afghani, Jalal al-e Ahman and his wife Simin Daneshcar
Some fun characters: Mirza Saleh Shirzi, Qurrat al-Ayn, Ibrahim Sinasi, Halide Edib

### Quotes

> After barely an hour the enemy was routed in an engagement which Napoleon christened the Battle of the Pyramids, whose mysterious forms could be made out through the haze, even if the majority of the French had no idea what they were. The causality figures--around one thousand Mamluks dead to twenty-nine Frenchmen--spoke of a hideous imbalance of tactics, training, and equipment, and [Sheikh Jabarti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd_al-Rahman_al-Jabarti) contrasted the efficiency of the infidel with the woeful defenders, who were 'at odds with each other, envious, fearful for their lives and their comforts, immersed in ignorance and self-delusion, arrogant and haughty in their attire and presumptuousness'. The result of the battle, furthermore, did not simply reflect the qualities of the two sides. A medieval Eastern army was annihilated by a modern Western one and a proud Islamic capital - Al-Qahira, 'the victorious' -- was lost to the infidel. 

> The country was on a trajectory that nowadays looks pathetically predictable, whereby an orential leader possessed of unlimited powers to incur emormous foreign debts he cannot possibly repay, leadig to increasingly close attention from his foreign and creditors, evventually, direct intervention.
>
> 'My country is now longer in Africa,' Ismail declared in 1878; 'we are now part of Europe.' But Egypt's foreign debt had soared from L3 million to L91 million in thirteen years, and the khedive was addressing these words to a international bankrucpy comission. Taxes had been hiked, cuasing much pain throughout the population, and Egypt's share of the canal offloaded to Disraeli' and while the army was paid in arrears, if at all, the foreign banks insisted on being paid their interset on time and in full.
> In February 1879 a defiant Ismail dismissed the European officials that Britain adn France had foisted on his government, but it was an ill-judged act of defiance and four months later a blunt telegram from the Porte, drafted under European pressure and addressed ot the 'ex-Khedive Ismail of Egypt', signalled that his reign was at an end. We was replaced by his 27-year old son Towfiq. 
> Sailing off to Naples on his yacht, the ex-khedive may have reflected on the ruins of his deisng to liberate Egypt from the Ottomans and raise it to parity with Britain and France. He had been unrestrained by accountability and his flights of fnatasy had opened the way to foreign involvement in the governmnet, which would, with th British occupation of 1882, expand into full-blown colonial control. The effects of this puncturing of national sovereigtny would have serious repecrussions on the moderinisation movement that had developed quite promisnly over the past three-quarters of a centyury.
> If the fate of Ismail might not have surprised Sheikh Jabarti, that sceptic of Western influence who in later life had depolored the venality of Muhammad Ali, it would have profoundly dismayed Rifaa al-Tahtawi, whose faith in the West and in the ability of the lands of Islam to learn from Europe while retaining their authenicity now seemed misplaced. From being a process of voluntary importation, the Islamic Enlightment as envisaged by such subtle minds as Rifaa and Hassan al-Attar was in danger of becomingly a costly and superficial imitation. In order for Egypt to propser once more it would need a guarantee against monarchical whim and foreign intervention: it was a guarantee, som would come to believe, that only constituional government could provide. 

> One of the tensions that one meets repeatidly in the story of the Islamic Enlightenment is that between a progressive despotism and a benighted popular will. In the case of the plague the benefits of the former will become apparent. Without Muhammad Ali's absolutism the plague could not have been eradicated in Egypt because the majoriy delpored the methods he employed and did much to obstruct them. In the event, his system bore fruit in barely a dozen years, as the figures showed (reliable body bounts were a crucial part o the struggle against the plague). In 1841 the number of deaths in ALexandria from the plague was down to 5,848; four years later the figure was zero. With the supression of the plague, of course, the obscurantists fell silent. Islaim came onto the side of prevention, and the selfsame sanitation measures that had been denounced as heretical entered the routines of life. 

> Alongside hte new attitudes to knowledge and God's will, Mahmud introduced a radical solution to the tension that was inveitable in an empire that had both an Islamic mission and a non-Mulsim majority - a solution strenosuly encouraged by the powers (Britain in particuar), but which he realised was essential to the empire's survival. Until Mahmud's reign the Ottomans had dealth with this contradiction bu granting minorities separae legal status. A hierarchy, with the ruling Mulsim elite on the top and non-Muslims underneath, had protected the minorities from the fatal uncetainties that in EUrope overshadowed any group that was not in power, as as a consequence the empire had been mostly free of pogroms, ghettos and inquisitions (indeed, an estimated 150,000 Jews fleeing the Spanish Inquistion in 1492 were welcomed to Turkey). But the benevolent subjugation was now running up against to precepts that were intrinsic to modernity. The Ottoman system of divigin subjects according to their religious ffiliation offended both against equality and national soveireingty. And the EUropeans powers, who viewed arrangements in the Ottoman Empire through the prism of self interest, had become cheerleaders for both. 
>
> Under Islam, the Jews and the various Christian groups (the Greek Orthodox and Greogrian Aermenains, for example) were protected subservient minorities called dhimmis. From this principle the Ottomoan state had developed its concept of religious gorups, or millets: commercially active, enojying access to schools, hospitals and so on, but discrimnated aginast by the sharia. Non-Muslims paid more taxes than Mulsims. The testimonry of a non-Muslim was worth half that of a Muslim. Few public positions were open to non-Muslims, and they were not permitted to bear arms. On the other hand, the millets enjoyed legal atonomy; they had separate tribunals and were judged by their own ecllesiastics who ran little theocracies inside the empire. The Greek patriach, for instance, was within his rights to send an Ottoman citizen from his community into exile. There was also no standard procedure for dealing with crimes such as theft or adultery, and each millet handled infractions according to its own statutes. It was relatively straightfoward for a Muslim Ottoman man to divorce his wife; for a Catholic Ottoman man it was impossible. If an Ottoman Mulsim stole an egg his hand was in the balance. A Catholic might get away with a few Hail Marys.
>
> Over the nineteenth century, the esureint powers seizedo n the millet system as a menas of keeping the Ottoman Empire in a weakened state. Essentially, the powers and the minorities paired off in stratgic romances while the Porte looked on in impotent fury. With the Greek Orthodox already accounted for by the tsar, France got together with the empire's Catholics. Britain's ambassador to Constantinople, the pious, irascible Sir Stratford Canning (later Lord Stratford de Redcliffe), offered his protection to the Protestant missionaries. There weren't many Ottoman Protestants, though the ambassador had high hopes. On Mount Lebanon, the Druze and the Maronites were courted by Britain and France, respectively. No one wanted the Jews. 

> The man who did more than anyone to raise Western hopes regarding the eventual abolition of slavery in the Middle East was Ahmad Bey, the Ottoman governor general of Tunis. Ahmad was a moderniser in the mould of Ehypt's Muhammad Ali and he realized the value of acting against slavery as a means of winning Western support for Tunisian independce from Ottoman riule. In 1841 he progibted the export of slaves from his dominion and closed the market in Tunis, a bombshell that eraned him British gratitude and opened the way for him to abolish slavery itself, in 1846 -- seventeen years before Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of 1863. Indeed, during the American Civil War the mayor of Tunis instructed the American consul general on the econmic advantages of abolition, arguing that the productivity of a free person was greater than that of a slave. 
>
> The importance of the aoblition edict that Ahmad Bey put before the country's parliament lay in the fact that it was full of Islamic legal arguments, rather than Western humanitarian ones. First, it stated, tthe cruel treatment of the slaves was inherently un-Islamic. Second, to prohibit slavery was to uphold the pious ideal of justice. Finally, the slavement of Muslims by other Muslims was illegal under Islamic law, and the majority of slaves from the bilad al-Sudan -- literally, 'land of the blacks' -- were at least nominally Muslim. 

> Cevdet must have been something of a freak in turn-of-the-century Diyarbakir, where religion of one kind or another permated almost everything. The CUP activist believed that opponents of Darinian thoery -- turbaned or otherwise -- should have their heads smashed, and a few years later he did hige his euophoria when the first Turkish aviator was killed, because it was proof tha the Turks were approaching European levels of fearless enquiry. 'When the European eplorers went ot the Artic,' Cevdet wrote, 'and their aviators flew into the skies, we used ot laugh at them say, "Look how these stupid Europeans get tthemselves eatern by polar bears and blown to pieces in lane crashes".' We did not realize that by these "stupid" acts they realised their dominion over the world. Now our men too have begun to crash. This is not something to gieve over. We must rejoice! For me, it is the sign that are regenerating and that we shall not die! 

> Such ideas were clearly anathema to the Islamists who emerged as ZIya's adveraries when the extent of his nationalist project became apparent. For them the very notion of a human identiy that verated artefacts from the pre-Islamic past was grotesque; the last thing they waned was for a commounity of so-called 'Turks' to set itself up as a rival to the umma. Nationalism, thurndered the Islamist scholar Ahmed Naim, was a 'foreign innnovation as deadly to the body of Islam as cancer is to a man ... at a time when the enermeny has set foot on our breasts it is madness to divide Islam into nationalities'. 

> Banna's letter, which was also circulated among many ordinary people, was of the opening manoeucres in Islam's counter-Enlightment. For peraps the first time since the beginning of the transformation of the Middle East at the turn of the nineteenth century, here was the leader of a modern Islamic movement poruing scorn on the West and its pretensions to superiority -- indeed, publicly rejecting the very materialist principles that reformers life Rifaa and the Tanzimatists had expended so much energy trying to reconcile with Islamic ideals. Now Banna, leader of a resurgent Ehyptian, Sunni Islam, was announcing that this job of sunthesis was over, and that simpler Islamic values like thrift, equality, conservative social values and traditional Islamic economics -- which offer a seductively middle-of-the-road blend of incentive and social conscience -- where the most effecive ways to deal with the modern world.
>
> The Islamism of Hassan al-Banna contained both elements of modern politics and a hankering for the past. Far from being a reflexive reactionary, Banna clearly appreciated that the Muslim world had changed irrevocably, and by laying emphasis on education, the need for investment in science and tehcnology, and the active roles open to women under Islamic government, he drew heavily on the achievemnts of earlier reformers. Nor did the layman Banna seek to reverse the clerical decline that had seen the sheikhs of al_Azhar lowered from their former positions as arbiters of society. He  also remained aloof from thos of this compatriots who were involved in an abortive attempt to reconsitute the caliphate in Cairo, with Farouk as caliph. Having adopted these modern idaels -- banking them, as it were, as authentic ISlamic capital -- Banna called for a resugent civilisation htat was ready to challegne the West, not as Atatturk and Reza Shah had done, on Western terms, but in the homeycomb of Islamic culture.
