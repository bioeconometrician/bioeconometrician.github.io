The Citigroup analysis is overblown, what about the wealth at the bottom of the pyramid?

> In a plutonomy there is no such animal as 'the US consumer' or 'the UK consumer' or indeed the 'the Russian consumer.' There are rich consumers, few in number but disproportionate in the gigantic slice of income and consumption they take. There are the rest, the non-rich, the multitudinous many, but only accounting for surprisingly small bites of the national pie. 

This is consumer hourglass theory, see Citigroup's Hourglass Index. But even though the index has performed well, the question is whether it will beat expectations going forward (i.e. we already know inequality is getting worse). 

Smith features prominently in the book. Lots of good quotes:

> The proprietor of land is necessarily a citizen of the particular country in which his estate lies. The proprietor of stock is necessarily a citizen of the world, and is not necessarily attached to any particular country. He would be apt to abandon the country in which he was exposed to a vexatious inquisition, in order to be assessed to a burdensome tax, and would remove his stock to some other country where he could either carry on his business, or enjoy his fortune more at his ease.

Superstar effects dramatically seen in some industries. Kruger study: between 1982 to 2003 share of concert revenue taken by top 5 percent of performers went from 62 to 84%, while the top 1 percent went from 26-53%. 

Freeland talks about the different effects:

1. Marshall effect (more affluent society bids up superstars, in Marshall's day the opera singers)
2. Sherwin Rosen effect
3. Roger Martin effect: superstars extract heftier commission for employers (labour beats capital)
4. Matthew Effect

## Fun facts

* in 1941, US government project USDA to make fifteen thousand dress measurement sizes, these created the standarded dress sizes used by the industry. 
* Between 2003 to 2011, at least fourteen Chinese billionaire businessmen were executed: "China's plutocrats don't fight the state because they are the state."

## O Canada

Lots of fun drama about the debate between Mark Carney and Blankfein. Contrasts regulatory race to the bottom of London and New York with Canada's sober perspective.
