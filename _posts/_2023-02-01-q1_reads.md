Words 

"Jesus Cover Up Thesis", Paul and James led two different religions. Luke/Acts made up an imaginary Jeruselum conferences of XXAD, which made it seem like there was one religion. This provides a "clean" explaination for the old vs new testament.

Pauline Christianity is about what Jesus was, rather than what he did. 

A lot of silly outrage. By what right did Paul usurp the prophets?!

Great irony an anti-Roman imperialist insurrection becomes the religion on the empire.
