In the 16th episode of the [Statistically Insignificant podcast](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/statisticallyinsig/), Erik and Jaryd have a 1:1 conversation reflecting on what they've learned since the start of the Covid pandemic. The guys reflect on why they should have taken more vacations, whether single-payer is likely to be sustainable as a healthcare model, if Jaryd consumed too much news, and how likely society is to act on any of the lessons learned.
