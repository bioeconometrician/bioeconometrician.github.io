A successful cultural invasion feels humiliating for several reasons. There is of course the timeless issue of sexual jealousy, the sight of "our women" being taken by the new male elite. There is also the galling shock that comes when a supposedly inferior civilization takes over. For the Greeks this was the unlettered Romans. For the Romans it was the unlettered Visigoths. For the Chinese it was the very much lettered Europeans. For the secular republican French, it is the medieval sharia of Islam.
