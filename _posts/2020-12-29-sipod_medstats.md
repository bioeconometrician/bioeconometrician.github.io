In episode 8 of the [Statistically Insignificant podcast](https://statisticallyinsignificant.sounder.fm/show/statistically-insignificant) Jaryd and I are joined by my good friend Eric Mackay, a Senior Statistician at [Cytel](https://www.cytel.com/). Eric has an academic background in econometrics and statistics, as well as extensive professional expertise in applied biostatistical analysis. We cover a variety of topics including why Eric left the economics profession, the difficulty of translating statistical concepts into practical terms, and whether international travel is overrated. Note: this episode contains the use of technical jargon which some listeners may find boring.

### Show notes

1. The likelihood of approval for oncology drugs is [only 5%](https://www.bio.org/sites/default/files/legacy/bioorg/docs/Clinical%20Development%20Success%20Rates%202006-2015%20-%20BIO,%20Biomedtracker,%20Amplion%202016.pdf), the lowest success rate for all medical indications
2. Vinay Prasad's critique of [surrogate endpoints](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-017-0902-9) and cancer drug [efficacy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5695531/)
3. Most cancer drug approvals are **not** based on [overall survival](https://www.bmj.com/content/366/bmj.l5399), and the majority of associated clinical studies are at [high risk](https://www.bmj.com/content/366/bmj.l5221) of statistical bias
4. [Statistical paradises and paradoxes of big data](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/files/statistics-2/files/statistical_paradises_and_paradoxes.pdf): 400 truly random samples can be better than 2.3 million observations if the latter have a measurement bias
5. [Machine learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/KDD2015FinalDraftIntelligibleModels4HealthCare_igt143e-caruanaA.pdf) algorithms can erroneously conclude that asthma is a "protective" factor for pneumonia due to observational confounding
