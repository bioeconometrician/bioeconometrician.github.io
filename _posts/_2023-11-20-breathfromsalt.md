As I sat through many of the workshops and plenary sessions at the 2023 North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference (NACFC) I couldn't help but notice the upbeat and ebullient attitude at the conference. Having just read Bijal Travedia's majestic history *Breath from Salt* about the history of Cystic Fibrosis (CF), it was clear that we had entered a new era in the chapter of CF. From patients dying in their teens in the 1970s and making up 20% of lung transplants as of X, this disease has now been transformed into something manageable for most. Perhaps the analogy of the year 1943 in WW2 is appropriate: the war is not over, and many countless more would sacrifice their lives before it was over, but it was clear that in time Hitler's war machine and Imperial Japan would eventually be "ground into dust." Once a disease of children (since almost no one lived beyond childhood), CF has now become a chronic disease of adults. As evidenced by the NACFC, there are now an army of countless researchers, students, postdocs, genetic counselors, nutritionists, physical therapists, nurses, doctors of all specialties, and companies now analyzing every aspect of the CF health ecosystem from optimal nutrition, to mental health effects, to cell line tests for ultra-rare forms of the disease that fall outside of the treatment perimeter. In the 1940s no one outside of maybe a dozen doctors even knew what the disease was. 

But before we get too far ahead of the story, this is a reminder that this post will be about Travedia's new book which has done for Cystic Fibrosis (CF) what Siddhartha Mukherjee did for cancer in the *Emperor of All Maladies*: write the definitive history of a disease that is both accessible and insightful for layperson and expert alike. Like the great writers of medicine, Travedia blends history, politics, economics, and science explaining the connections between different innovations and how they shaped our understanding of the disease and led to therapeutic breakthroughs. She also gives powerful and tear-inducing stories of persons with CF (pwCF), their parents, and health care practitioners who treat them. This book will likely remain the definitive history of CF until, possibly, a new chapter of the disease is written with the next era of treatments.[[^1]] If you want to understand how a disease which once killed most infants before their second birthday and whose etiology was unknown and unclassified until the 1930s, now has a life expectancy of 60+ you need to understand the remarkable innovations and scientific breakthroughs that were necessary to get to the triple-modulator therapies of today. At the this NACFC conference this year, one speaker suggested that CF was becoming like AIDs, a complex disease that causes many commodities and requires medical expertise to treat, but with the right care plan can give individuals normal lives. 

For those who have never heard of CF or only have a vague impression of the disease, it is the most common rare disease in the Caucasian population that is also *lethal*.[[^2]] CF is a monogenic disease, meaning having a single mutation on the CFTR gene in the "wrong" place can lead to the CF disease.[[^3]] The CFTR gene encodes for the CFTR protein which helps to facilitate chloride ion conductance at the cellular level which determines how acidic/salty something is?? (remember that table salt is roughly 60% sodium and 40% chloride). When this gene is not working properly, then cells are unable to facilitate chloride ion transfer which results in dry and sticky mucus which accumulates in the lungs and pancreas. Over time this leads to chronic infections and bacterial colonies which can cause permanent damage to the lungs and other organs.[[^4]] Historically, X% of patients waiting for lung transplants had CF. To put the prevalence of CF into perspective, there are 30K living patients in the US, XK for Canada, XK in Europe, and ZK in the rest of the world. Although CF is certainly under-diagnosed in places like China and India, the Caucasian population is certainly at higher risk for the disease.[[^5]] 

It bears repeating that the story of CF is not just fascinating because of the remarkable increase in life expectancy (2 years to 60 years), but also because of the unique way that the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) was organized and specifically pushed and funded treatments for CF. Similar to the way that the 18th century abolitionists created the modern concept of societal campaigns with pamphlets, chapters, and political lobbying, the CFF showed how the not-for-profit sector could push and incentivize pharmaceutical companies and researchers to study the disease they wanted and develop treatments by providing hundreds of millions of dollars of funding over the years. The CFF developed the idea of **venture philanthropy**, which has been emulated since by groups like the Gates foundation. If you want to understand how a group of patients suffering from a rare disease can help to shape the the funding priorities of granting agencies like the NIH, researchers pursuing academic fame, pharmaceutical companies pursuing profits, and philanthropists wanting to make an impact, then the success of CF is the model to understand. Full stop. 

The story of CF is still being written. But here is its remarkable journey so far.

## **Dum spiro spero**

In the year 2012 the FDA approved the drug Kalydeco as the first pharmaceutical intervention for CF which actually targeted the molecular nature of the CFTR protein deficiency in those with the disease. How did this drug come to fruition? Normally pharmaceutical companies invest their own money (billions of dollars) into each drug that goes through clinical trials (most fail) and then recover the development cost for a portfolio of drugs (and then some) by charging as much as the market will bear for as long as their drug has patent protection in the United States.[[^6]] Kalydeco was different. Though it was produced by Vertex Pharmaceuticals (??) it was the nonprofit Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) that had ponied up hundreds of millions of dollars to support its development in the early stages. Where did a non-profit get this amount of money to align the incentives of commercial entities with CF patients? We'll get to that later, but a businessman named Joe O'Donnell who spearheaded the fundraising efforts is owed a great deal of credit.

Cystic Fibrosis must been with our human ancestors for thousands of years (the F508del mutation likely emerged in the [Bronze Age](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6244163/)). But until the modern era, X% of children died before the age of 5, so it would have merely been another unexplained malady or curse from the gods to deal with. The first written record we have of CF was X. In the 1930s [Dorothy Hanson Andersen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Hansine_Andersen) began investigations into the curious circumstances of some of children who died in New York City's Babies Hospital. Babies born with CF who are pancreatic insufficient will be unable to produce the enzymes necessary to breakdown food and absorb nutrients and calories. Despite non-stop feeding they will fail to gain weight and will show symptoms of starvation like kwashiorkor (swollen belly). Babies who died in these conditions were labelled as has "celiac disease", a catch all concept for those who were unable to absorb or take up food. But Andersen wasn't satisfied with this overly broad explanation. In 1936, Andersen was performing an autopsy on a 3-year old girl known as MD and she noticed that while almost all of her organs were fine, the panaceas "was filled with fibrous cysts" and the pancreatic duct was "lost in a mass of tough scar tissue."

> It was clear that this organ couldn't possibly have been doing its job. That explained the patient's malnutrition. But Andersen has never seen a celiac patient with a pancreas that was so damaged. She began combing the medical journals for clues spending all of her free time hunting through stacks of books and journals in nearby Columbia University's library for mentions of similar cases, and exploring autopsy files of other children who had been diagnosed with celiac disease. She soon discovered reports from Boston to Europe to Australia describing similar fibrous pancreatic cysts in other children who had been classified as celiac patients. But she knew that kids with celiac disease, once they were prescribed the right died, didn't usually die; they grew quite normally. Perhaps MD didn't have celiac disease at all. In fact, based on the state of the cystic, fibrotic pancreas, she was fairly sure she didn't. Surrounded by an ocean of medical literature in Columbia' library, Andersen realized this could be an entirely new disease - only that, unlike celiac, was incredibly deadly.

Andersen published the first [academic paper](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/1177974) describing CF in 1938, and from that point became one of the leading scholars and practitioners in the field, helping to pioneer nutritional regimens which extended the lifespan of children by many years. Until the end of her life in 1963, she would regularly correspond with parents from across the United States and was described as an "extra parent" to the children suffering from CF. 

> While no one knew the cause of this disease, thanks to Andersen's work it was at least possibly to accurately diagnose children with it. Now physicians could give them the nutritional support they needed -- a small but critical step toward keeping these children in good health for as long as possible.

## The fog begins to lift

An old medieval saying reveals that our pre-modern ancestors were obliquely aware of cystic fibrosis: *Woe is the child who tastes salty from a kiss on the brow, for he is cursed, and soon must die.* The first written [reference](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2130674/) of CF has been found in 1595 by Pieter Pauw - a Professor of Botany and Anatomy at the University of Leiden - who noted that an 11 year old girl had a *swollen hardened gleaming white pancreas.* At the time, children born with sweaty skin were assumed to be "bewitched." A physician named [Paul di Sant'Agnese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_di_Sant%27Agnese) was the to connect the now well-documented pathologies of CF (pancreatic insufficiency and lung infection) with a seemingly more benign phenotype: salty skin. Andersen had hired Sant'Agnese to work at The Babies Hospital to accommodate the growing number of CF children that were coming every year. In the swealtering hot summers of 1948 and 1949, di Sant'Agnese noted something strange: many of his patients were showing up with heat stroke - at one time of all children admitted. A further curiosity presented itself:

> Sitting in a room with one patient, di Sant'Agnese notice that when the little boy put down his glass after gulping down water, the surface was decorated with ghostly white, salty fingerprints. The other children left similar prints, which inspired the physician to begin investigating the physiology of sweat. 

Sensing the potential for a diagnostic breakthrough, di Sant'Agnese [ran experiments](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/12/5/549/39262/ABNORMAL-ELECTROLYTE-COMPOSITION-OF-SWEAT-IN) 43 CF patients and 50 controls and found that the Chloride levels in the CF population was 3-5 times higher than those without the disease. The concentrations of chloride that di Sant'Agnese found in the early 1950s (60-160 mEq/L), represents the current threshold used to diagnose CF patients (>60 mEq/L). Not only did these findings point to a radical and somewhat baffling molecular origin of CF, on a more practical level they meant that CF patients could now be diagnosed with a sweat test rather than a highly invasive "duodenal procedure" which tested for enzymes found in the small intestine. By 1959 the physicians Gibson and Cooke and refined the [sweat test method](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13633369/) which is almost identical to [diagnostic test](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8459588/) used today.

[^1]: As of 2023, there are two main lanes of attacking the disease through pharmaceutical interventions. The first is extending the current small-molecule "modulator therapy" approach that has yielded amazing results to many patients to the 5-10% of CF patients who have mutations that do not seem to work with the current approach. The second is actuallly solving the problem "once and for all" using gene therapy which would require inserting genetic material into the cells which are not producing the CFTR gene they should be producing (e.g. lung and pancreas). Keep reading the post to learn more about the history of gene therapy with CF and why this time might be different. 

[^2]: There are other "rare diseases" (defined as X), like MS, which are more common than CF. But unlike CF, MS is not considered lethal since it doesn't lower life expectancy (?).

[^3]: Mutation here can refer to a single point mutation (i.e. one single base pair or "letter" of the DNA being different from what most people have) as well as deletions (most people with CF are missing three side-by-side letters known as the F508del mutation), insertions, and substitutions. 

[^4]: Basically once the lung tissue becomes sufficiently scarred and damaged then oxygen will never be able to go through that part of the lungs and patients with CF will slowly lose the ability to breathe. 

[^5]: Around 1/30 Caucasian American adults are carriers for the disease meaning that if they produce a child with another CF carrier, there is a 25% chance that the child will inherit two copies of the "bad" CFTR gene and develop CF. Although interestingly, the variation in outcomes for children with the same CF mutations can be quite different. This could be because of environment factors (like time of diagnosis and treatment quality) or other complex epistatic factors (any studies of this??). 

[^6]: I say the US since pharmaceutical companies, both US and non-US ones, derive X% of their profits in this market. This is partly related to the fact that the US is the largest economy in the world, but even for comparable economies (e.g. the European Union), the US government cannot negotiate drug prices - although this is just beginning to change - so consumers ultimately pay monopoly prices (although technically "payers" like private insurance companies and Medicare/Medicaid pay, they get their money from premiums and tax dollars so the general population pays one way or the other other). There are also all sorts of clever ways the pharmaceutical companies can increase their chance of "winning" at clinical trials (see [Malignant]()) and "[ever-greening]()" their patents, but that is a topic for another day.
