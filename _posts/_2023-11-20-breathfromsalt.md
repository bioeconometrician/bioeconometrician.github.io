As I sat through many of the workshops and plenary sessions at the 2023 North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference ([NACFC](https://www.nacfconference.org/)) I couldn't help but notice the upbeat energy of the conference. Having just read Bijal Travedia's majestic history *Breath from Salt* about the history of cystic fibrosis (CF), it made all the more sense; we were in a new era of cystic fibrosis (CF). For most of the disease's history, patients died as children, or maybe in their teens if they were lucky. Now, many individuals with CF are making it to retirement. Some estimates are even suggesting that children with CF born today may have [close-to-normal](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36849331/) life expectancy. For a disease with a life expectancy of 5 years in the 1950s, this change is absolutely staggering.[[^1]] 

Persons with CF (pwCF) and their family members are an extremely well organized group. While every developed country has a national CF foundation (e.g. [Cystic Fibrosis Canada](https://www.cysticfibrosis.ca/)), the US-based Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) acts as the lodestar of the movement. As the first sentence of their mission statement makes clear: "The mission of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation is to cure cystic fibrosis." Amazingly, even though 95% of patients are now eligible for life-saving treatments, none of the momentum has been lost and CFF and broader research community is still pursuing a [path to the cure](https://www.cff.org/research-clinical-trials/path-cure-many-routes-one-mission). Success has emboldened the community further success.[[^2]]

More than 4500 individuals participated in the 2023 NACFC. There is now an army of countless researchers, students, postdocs, genetic counselors, nutritionists, physical therapists, nurses, doctors of all specialties, and companies who are engaged with this disease. At the poster session of the conference, I saw research that analyzed every aspect of the CF health ecosystem from optimal nutrition, to mental health, to cell line tests for ultra-rare forms of the disease that fall outside of the treatment perimeter. To put this is historical perspective, in the 1940s no one outside of maybe a dozen doctors even knew what the disease was. 

To understand the amazing gains in CF, you need to understand both the remarkable history of scientific breakthroughs and the organizational structures that enabled them. Travedia's new book provides an accessible and comprehensive history of the disease. I suspect this book will be the definitive account of CF until a new chapter of the disease is written with the next era of gene therapy treatments.[[^3]] 

*Breath from Salt* has strong parallels both in terms of quality and comprehensiveness with *Emperor of All Maladies*, Siddhartha Mukherjee's book about the history of cancer. Like the other great writers of medicine, Travedia's narrative blends history, politics, and science. Each discovery in the disease's history is connected, and we can see how the accumulation of these discoveries led to therapeutic breakthroughs of today. The book contains many powerful and tear-inducing stories of pwCF, and the impact that death has on families. Readers who are interested in organizational structures and research politics will also find this book essential reading to understand the pioneering venture philanthropy model the CFF used to fund and generate research for this disease. 

For those who have never heard of CF or only have a vague impression of the disease, it is one of the most common rare disease in the Caucasian population that is also *lethal*.[[^4]] CF is an autosomal recessive monogenic disorder, meaning **if** both pairs of your chromosomes have a mutation (recall you have a two pairs of each chromosome, one from your mother and one from your father), you will (almost surely) develop the disease.[[^5]] The CFTR gene contains the instructions for making the CFTR protein. This protein facilitates chloride ions to move in and out of cells. These chloride ions play a key role in controlling how salty or acidic our body fluids and tissues are (recall that table salt is about 60% sodium and 40% chloride). In our bodies, the balance of these ions is crucial for normal function.

When this gene is not working properly, cells are unable to facilitate chloride ion transfer which results in dry and sticky mucus which accumulates in the lungs and prevents the pancreas from producing proper enzymes.[[^6]] Over time, pwCF can experience chronic infections and a build up of bacterial colonies which can cause permanent damage to the lungs and other organs.[[^7]] [Historically](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4780574/), 1 in 6 of patients waiting for lung transplants had CF. There are 105K pwCF globally, of which the US ([40K](https://www.cff.org/news/2022-07/cf-foundation-estimates-increase-cf-population)) and Europe ([55K](https://www.ecfs.eu/ecfspr)) make up >90% of the diagnosed population. Although CF is certainly under-diagnosed in places like China and India, the Caucasian population is at the highest risk for the disease.[[^8]] 

It bears repeating that the story of CF is not just fascinating because of the remarkable increase in life expectancy, but also because of the unique way that the CFF was organized and was able to push and incentivize treatments for CF. Similar to the way that the 18th century abolitionists created the modern concept of societal campaigns with pamphlets, chapters, and political lobbying, the CFF showed how the not-for-profit sector could push and incentivize pharmaceutical companies and researchers to study the disease they wanted and develop treatments by providing hundreds of millions of dollars of funding over the years. The CFF developed the idea of **venture philanthropy**, which has been emulated since by groups like the Gates Foundation, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and other rare disease groups (like ALS and multiple myeloma). If you want to understand how a group of patients suffering from a rare disease can help to shape the the funding priorities of granting agencies like the NIH, the topics researchers focus on, the product portfolio of pharmaceutical companies, and the donations from wealthy philanthropists, then the success of CF is the model to understand. Full stop. 

The story of CF is still being written. But here is its remarkable journey so far.
 
<br>

## **Dum spiro spero**

In the year 2012 the FDA approved the drug Kalydeco as the first pharmaceutical intervention for CF which actually targeted the molecular nature of the CFTR protein deficiency in those with the disease. How did this drug come to fruition? Normally pharmaceutical companies invest their own money (billions of dollars) into each drug that goes through clinical trials (most fail), but are able to stay profitable by (more than) recovering their fixed and variable costs by charging as much as the market will bear for as long as their drug has patent protection in the United States.[[^9]] But Kalydeco's development model was different from any other drug at the time. Though it was developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals, almost all of the early exploratory work and costs were paid for by the non-profit CFF. Where did a non-profit get the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to align the incentives of commercial entities with CF patients? We'll get to that later, but a businessman named Joe O'Donnell who spearheaded the fundraising efforts is owed a great deal of credit.

Cystic Fibrosis must been with our human ancestors for thousands of years (the F508del mutation likely emerged in the [Bronze Age](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6244163/)). But until the modern era, most children died before the age of 5, so it would have merely been another unexplained malady. In the 1930s [Dorothy Hanson Andersen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Hansine_Andersen) began investigating the curious circumstances around some of children who died in New York City's Babies Hospital. Babies born with CF who are pancreatic insufficient will be unable to produce the enzymes necessary to breakdown food and absorb nutrients and calories. Despite non-stop feeding they will fail to gain weight and will show symptoms of starvation like kwashiorkor (swollen belly). Babies who died in these conditions were labelled as having "celiac disease," a catch all concept for those who were unable to absorb or take up food. But Andersen wasn't satisfied with this overly broad explanation. In 1936, Andersen was performing an autopsy on a 3-year old girl known as MD and she noticed that while almost all of her organs were fine, the panaceas "was filled with fibrous cysts" and the pancreatic duct was "lost in a mass of tough scar tissue."

> It was clear that this organ couldn't possibly have been doing its job. That explained the patient's malnutrition. But Andersen had never seen a celiac patient with a pancreas that was so damaged. She began combing the medical journals for clues, spending all of her free time hunting through stacks of books and journals in nearby Columbia University's library for mentions of similar cases, and exploring autopsy files of other children who had been diagnosed with celiac disease. She soon discovered reports from Boston to Europe to Australia describing similar fibrous pancreatic cysts in other children who had been classified as celiac patients. But she knew that kids with celiac disease, once they were prescribed the right diet, didn't usually die; they grew quite normally. Perhaps MD didn't have celiac disease at all. In fact, based on the state of the cystic, fibrotic pancreas, she was fairly sure she didn't. Surrounded by an ocean of medical literature in Columbia' library, Andersen realized this could be an entirely new disease - only that, unlike celiac, was incredibly deadly.

Andersen published the first [academic paper](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/1177974) describing CF in 1938, and from that point became one of the leading scholars and practitioners in the field, helping to pioneer nutritional regimens which extended the lifespan of children by many years. Until the end of her life in 1963, she would regularly correspond with parents from across the United States and was described as an "extra parent" to the children suffering from CF. 

> While no one knew the cause of this disease, thanks to Andersen's work it was at least possibly to accurately diagnose children with it. Now physicians could give them the nutritional support they needed -- a small but critical step toward keeping these children in good health for as long as possible. 

<br>

## The fog begins to lift

An old medieval saying reveals that our pre-modern ancestors were aware of CF: *Woe is the child who tastes salty from a kiss on the brow, for he is cursed, and soon must die.* The first written [reference](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2130674/) of CF has been found in 1595 by Pieter Pauw - a Professor of Botany and Anatomy at the University of Leiden - who noted that an 11 year old girl had a *swollen hardened gleaming white pancreas.* At the time, children born with sweaty skin were assumed to be "bewitched." 

In the late 1940s, a physician named [Paul di Sant'Agnese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_di_Sant%27Agnese) was the to connect the now well-documented pathologies of CF (pancreatic insufficiency and lung infection) with a seemingly more benign phenotype - that of salty skin. Andersen had hired Sant'Agnese to work at The Babies Hospital to accommodate the growing number of CF children that were coming every year. In the swealtering hot summers of 1948 and 1949, di Sant'Agnese noted something strange: many of his patients were showing up with heat stroke - at one time of all children admitted. A further curiosity presented itself:

> Sitting in a room with one patient, di Sant'Agnese notice that when the little boy put down his glass after gulping down water, the surface was decorated with ghostly white, salty fingerprints. The other children left similar prints, which inspired the physician to begin investigating the physiology of sweat. 

Sensing the potential for a diagnostic breakthrough, di Sant'Agnese [ran experiments](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/12/5/549/39262/ABNORMAL-ELECTROLYTE-COMPOSITION-OF-SWEAT-IN) on 43 individuals with CF and 50 without, and found that the chloride levels in the CF population was 3-5 times higher than those without the disease. The concentrations of chloride that di Sant'Agnese found in the early 1950s (60-160 mEq/L), represents the current threshold used to diagnose CF patients (>60 mEq/L). Not only did these findings point to a radical and somewhat baffling molecular origin of CF, on a more practical level they meant that CF patients could now be diagnosed with a sweat test rather than a highly invasive "duodenal procedure" which tested for enzymes found in the small intestine.[[^10]] By 1959 the physicians Gibson and Cooke and refined the [sweat test method](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13633369/) which is almost identical to [diagnostic test](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8459588/) used today.

Based on the history outlined in *Breath from Salt*, I would assert that the modern CF era began in the 1950s. This decade saw the creation of reliable diagnostic testing, the first reference of CF in a medical textbook (penned by di Sant'Agnese of course), and the first national organization in the US that started to raise awareness about the disease and begin collecting funds for research that might one day lead to treatments. In 1948 when di Sant'Agnese first noticed the "salty fingerprints," there was no treatments for the disease beyond nutritional regimens, there was no support for parents beyond a handful of experts like Andersen, no one knew what caused CF, and no one seemed to be looking into how the disease might be actually be treated. Every new diagnosis of CF at that time was therefore a tragedy akin to a childhood cancer. But with each draw of this horrible genetic lottery, a growing population of grieving families began to demand change and answers for their children. 

In 1953 the first son of a wealthy socialite named Wynne Sharples was born with CF, and a year later their first daughter was as well. Wynne's family was sufficiently well-connected that her father was able to set up a meeting of the director of Boston Children's Hospital who in turn summoned Harry Shwachman, one the leading CF physicians, who agreed to personally supervise the care of her children. Wynne knew about some of the other grass roots movements that had started up, but was uninterested in participating efforts she considered to be too amateur. She understood that advancing research on this disease would require bringing together top scientists to find a cure, wealthy society types to bring awareness, and funds, and politicians who could wield influence. In her vision, Wynne saw local grassroots as feeders which could fund a higher profile national foundation. 

The inaugural meeting of the National Cystic Fibrosis Research Foundation (NCFRF) was held in 1955 in Philadelphia. Early on it was clear that was going to be tension between the vision of the national foundation, and the grass roots organizations being run by parents who wanted any help they could get treating their increasingly sick children. This initial tension would continue for the next 50-60 years until most pwCF had access to modulator therapies. But at a time when not only was there no pharmaceutical treatment on the horizon, but the underlying cause of the disease was unknown, the prospect of spending money on basic research while families desperately needed help with nutritional supplementation, constant hospital visits, and physiotherapy must have been a wrenching decision.  

As president of the NCFRF, Sharples top priorities in 1957 were education and finding a research director. The foundation put together booklets and quarterly newsletters for foundation members and Sharples recruited Andersen, di Sant'Agnese, and Shwachman to review the material. 

> The research director would be a foundation employee tasked with knowing everything possible about the disease-including which researchers would be most likely to study it. That same individual would also be in charge of encouraging those researchers' interest in this rare condition. Money, Sharples knew, was the only way to fund research and develop a cure. She hoped that as the public learned more about the disease they would be generous and provide the funds.

In order for the public to learn more, the NCFRF ensured that newspapers across North America mentioned the disease. In the Bergen Evening Record from [April 12th 1957](https://www.newspapers.com/image/490440012), Sharples made clear that,

> ... "Our mothers and fathers, together with their friends, are encouraged by the example of the polio foundation. It was with the persistence of local chapters which raised the necessary funds to mount the all-out assault on polio, leading to a successful vaccine. **Intensive medical research alone will enable us to solve the problem of cystic fibrosis. We know that we can count on the generous support of American parents toward this end**."

Later that year, a [NYT article](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1957/10/13/96959805.html?pageNumber=72) declared a "War of Cystic Fibrosis," and also made references to the success that the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP) - aka the "March of the Dimes" - had for the development of a vaccine for polio. The timing for CF was fortuitous. The astounding results of Salk's polio vaccine were released in 1955, and the news of the vaccine's effectiveness was greeted with an outpouring of public joy. Church bells rang, factory whistles blew, and spontaneous gatherings occurred in streets and public places. People were overjoyed and relieved, as the vaccine promised to end a terrifying health scourge. Importantly for CF, this seminal biomedical event helped to shape the public perception that publicly funded scientific advances could cure diseases. Before the vaccine, thousands of children were paralyzed every year, afterwards, almost none were. 

Doris Tulcin was another of the key founders of the NCFRF and leveraged her family's connections to run high-profile fundraisers, as well as increase the ties between the NCFRF and Basil O'Connor, the president of the NFIP. Although O'Conner suggested to Doris Tulcin and George Frankel (Doris' father) that they consider merging the NCFRF with the NFIP, the idea was politely rebuffed. But, with agreement from the NFIP, George suggested that they recruit seasoned staff from the NFIP to join NCFRF to replicate some of the magic they achieved with polio for CF. 

Basil distilled for Tulcin and her organization the key lessons he lad learned from polio and the NFIP.[[^11]] The first was that if the public was going to help fund raise for the disease they needed to know about it and feel connected to the cause. The NFIP used public relations experts to gain national exposure, and came up with innovative national campaigns like the "March of the Dimes." The second was that fundraising would be key to generating the funds needed for research. Money was money, and the NFIP used everything from high-brow black tie events to local neighborhood fundraisers like bake sales to national campaigns. Third, and most crucially, funds should be earmarked to research rather than patient care. While helping patients is more compassionate in the short term, the longer term gains from a treatment will always outweigh any short-term humanitarian impulses. The NFIP originally prioritized helping patients through services like the [Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warm_Springs_Historic_District), but later changed tack. 

Hired in 1946, [Harry Weaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_M._Weaver) was the NFIP's director of research who took a "ruthless approach to research funding... \[and\] single-handedly catalyzed the pace of polio research." The NFIP designed short-term grants that were designed to answer specific questions that would move the science closer to a vaccine. If the research showed promising results, the grant was renewed, if not, it was terminated. Weaver also supported funding competing approaches to vaccines, believing that the natural competition between scientists would catalyze their work (especially when their pet theories were on the line). But how to get actual scientists to apply for grants and take an interest in the disease? Weaver stressed the importance of cultivating goodwill with the scientific community and ingratiating oneself with the universities by paying for new facilities and their overheard expenses. After a few years of going all in on research, the science of polio had progressed to the point where a full scale vaccine trial could be run. The NFIP spent $55 million to run a trial of more than 1.3 million children in 1954 (and still constitutes the largest trial even run), and made sure that no cost was spared. All ancillary trial costs were covered including the subsequent statistical analyses. When the rollout of a life-preserving vaccine is at stick, it's foolish to be miserly when a single day can be the difference between health and sickness.[[^12]]

Every one of these recommendations would in one way or the other be leveraged by the NCFRF (which became the CFF) and the CF community more broadly. While CF could leverage these insights, the situation was quite different compared to polio. Only a small number of children were at risk of being born with CF ever year (in contrast every parents was afraid their children might develop polio), polio had the president of the United States (Franklin D Roosevelt) as a brand ambassador, and the existing science of inoculation (while still young) would prove sufficient for finding a cure. Not only would a vaccine not be possible for CF, no one even knew what caused the disease or what a treatment would look like.


<br>

## Show me the data

> Less than five years after its launch, the foundation had gathered significant strength, power, and visibility, and they were ready to launch what they saw as the next stage in the battle against the disease: the creation of centers dedicated to treating and caring for children with cystic fibrosis. 

Due to disagreements with the leadership at the NCFRF, including with Dorothy Anderson, Wynne Sharply agreed to step down and a trucking executive named Robert Natal assumed the role in 1960. These were critical years. Kenneth Landauer had become the foundation's new director of research and education and helped to found a series of medical centers for cystic fibrosis patients across the country. The idea was not new, and Landauer drew on his experience having set up similar centers for polio. However, the need for these centers proved to be short-lived after to the rapid success of the polio vaccine. However, cystic fibrosis wasn't disappearing anytime soon, and CF patients desperately needed standardized protocols and treatment practices that were grounded in evidence-based medicine. The NCFRF was essential in ensuring that any centers in this network actually had an incentive to adopt best practices and maximize patient outcomes. 

But was they data that could be used to determine the best practices for the treatment of CF? And furthermore, what exactly *was* CF? True, Dorothy Anderson had shown fibrotic cysts found on the pancreas distinguished CF kids from other disease types, but the variations in disease progression and symptoms varied substantially. Only by concentrating pwCF into care centers could the range of clinical symptoms be documented, and crucially, form the basis of knowledge for practitioners in this space. 

Based on the polio experience, these initial CF care centers were focused on both treatment and research, and could request unlimited funding from the national foundation. These two policies, creating academic medical centers with access to deep research funds led to a mini-boom in the number of PhDs studying CF. The advice O'Conner had passed onto Tulcin and that was pushed by Sharples was now being executed by Landauer. Institutions and money were creating a CF research agenda. 

Anyone who had analyzed healthcare data or studied healthcare economics knows a fascinating, and arguably disturbing, phenomena: the quality and cost of medicine varies tremendously across providers. Atul Gawande famously referred to this as the [bell curve](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/12/06/the-bell-curve) of medicine. We all understand that there is going to be variation in medicine. Sometimes a hospital is short-staffed, a doctor is a recovering from a flu, and X-ray technician hasn't slept in 24 hours, etc. But the statistical estimates of the variation are often of a [concerning size](https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2018.36.30_suppl.36). By 1964 it was clear that one CF care center, the Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, was doing better than any other CF center, and by a long shot. Most children were dying at the age of 3, but somehow in Cleveland they were dying at the age of 21. How could life expectancy be 7-fold higher? 

In 1955 Cleveland established its own local branch of the NCFRF and shortly afterwards convinced the chairman of pediatrics at the Babies and Children's hospital to launch a research-based treatment program for CF. A 29-year old doctor named LeRoy Matthews was tapped to the run the program. While Matthews found the prospect daunting, he was a man who never lacked self-confidence, and saw the tremendous opportunity this represented for a young physician. Matthews was Harvard educated and had previously studied under Harry Shwachman and Sidney Farber, giving him an amazing set of connections and knowledge about a disease that was largely unknown in the developed world at the time. 

He approached the problem analytically and did a whistle stop tour to centers with existing CF practices. In Boston, Shwachman told Matthews about his physiotherapy regimes that percussed the chest with and vibrations so that the mucus could be coughed up. He also learned about Shwachman's low-fat nutrition regimen and *shock and awe* multi-course antibiotic treatments to "pummel the tenacious bacteria infecting the lungs." At the Babies Hospital in New York, Matthews learned from Anderson and di Sant'Agnese about different diagnostic testing strategies for the disease as well as its nuances that only decades of practice could afford. Moving onto Philadelphia, Wynne Sharples and her husband Dr. Robert Denton, who was a pediatrician, showed Matthews his nebulizer invention that helped to loosen the hard mucus. 

Within a few years of opening his clinic, Matthews had cut the mortality rate substantially. His analytical approach was matched with an equally impressive ability to connect on a personal and emotional level to both patients and parents. Constant vigilance is what determined mediocre and exceptional outcomes in CF. The requirements around percussive physiotherapy, oral antibiotics, and nebulizers were strict and challenging, but could also provided a sense of accomplishments and participation. While Matthews was admired for his dedication by his patients, his colleagues were not as impressed, especially as he enjoyed touting his success loudly. He once told one conference of physicians that “how long \[our patients\] will live remains to be seen, but I expect most of them to come to my funeral.” His braggadocio was met with skepticism and jealously by other physicians, many of who assumed Matthews' data was simply fake. 

In part to settle the dispute between Matthews and his skeptical counterparts, a young pediatrician named [Warren Warwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Warwick) (who would later co-invent the first mechanical vest to help clear the airways of mucus) created a one-page questionnaire for each CF center to complete for each patient at their center. Warwick was meticulous and his small team ensured that the data was complete across the 30 centers that existed at the time and was anonymized to ensure analysis would not be biased. Sure enough, the results in the early 1960s showed that Matthews' clinic claims were true: his center had a rock-bottom mortality rate and average age of death of 21. The skeptics were not convinced and another analysis was done by [Cecil Nesbitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_J._Nesbitt) who recapitulated the results. 

Having unambiguously demonstrated that Cleveland's CF clinic was doing something special, Matthews worked with Landauer to create national treatment guidelines based on his center's approach. The survey that Warwick developed would now be used to annual reports for each center, which would show the rank of that center in comparison to others. Warwick was asked by other CF foundations in Canada, Australia, England, and Sweden to create similar surveys and reports for them as well. 


> The patient registry that Warwick originally crated for the NCFRF would eventually be replicated by other disease nonprofits and biomedical institutions across the world. **Though neither Warwick nor the foundation's leaders could have known it at the time, the patient registry would eventually prove to be the foundation's most valuable asset--key to understanding the progression and nuances of the disease--and, decades later, it would further revolutionize patient treatment**.

## The end of the beginning

By 1980 things had improved markedly for the CF community since Anderson's paper was published nearly 40 years ago. Many babies were receiving accurate diagnoses much earlier, and being treated with prophylactics that targeted the symptoms of the disease. Life expectancy was now in the mid to late teens. But the fundamental biology, or *etiology*, of the disease was still unknown. By the end the decade however, the fundamental biology of CF would be elucidated, giving the tantalizing hope that a "cure" would be around the corner.

Everyone knew that CF patients had salty sweat, with chloride levels showing variation but usually being above 60 mmol/L. But besides cases of extreme heat, this salty sweat didn't in and of itself point to anything sinister. Yes, something about the genetics of the CF disease was giving rise to this phenotype, but how did salty skin connect with any of the other pathologies like lung infections or pancreatic insufficiency? 

[Dr. Richard Boucher](https://www.med.unc.edu/medicine/pulmonary/people/boucher/) was doing experiments in the late 1970s on the physiology of lung diseases. He knew that in diseases like asthma or COPD the mucus in the lungs was too dry. Normally our mucus is around 98% water, 1% salt, and 1% [mucins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucin). This balance between dry and wet is carefully calibrated so that the mucus is sticky enough to trap unwanted pathogens, but fluid enough that our cilia (broom-like hairs) can "sweep" the mucus up the lungs so that we can cough up the gunk that we incidentally inhale. Boucher hypothesized since water is attracted to electrolytes (like chloride and sodium), perhaps these diseases are caused by disruptions in salt transfer across the cell membranes. Luckily for a researcher, whenever electrolytes move they generate electrical activity, meaning that voltage measurements could be used to compare differences with healthy volunteers.

In the case of asthma, Boucher's hypothesis was wrong, the voltage was the same for healthy and asthmatic patients. But Boucher knew of CF and the associated sweat test. Now at UNC, Boucher teamed up with another young physician [Michael Knowles](https://www.med.unc.edu/medicine/pulmonary/people/knowles/) where they tested the voltage of the nasal passage between normal and CF patients. The r[esults were astonishing](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7300874/): CF patients had voltage levels three times more (negative) then healthy controls. While nasal cells are a good proxy for lung cells,[[^13]] Boucher and Knowles needed to be sure the results were replicable in the lung cells of CF patients where the actual problems occurred. 

On the verge of a massive breakthrough Boucher and Knowles needed to confirm whether the problem of "sweaty" cells was caused by chloride, sodium, or both. First they applied a medication which would block sodium being able to move into the nasal epithelial cells. Sure enough, the voltage reading was now back at the normal level. Next, they rinsed the nose which temporarily removed the chloride. In non-CF patients the chloride returned the surface of the cell which could be registered as a large negative voltage. However, for the CF patients the voltage remained unchanged meaning that the chloride was not getting replaced at the cell surface. Boucher and Knowles had [now demonstrated](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6853720/) at the chemical level what was going on: too much sodium flowing into the cells, and too little chloride flowing out, both of which caused the mucus to become drier. In other words, with chloride being unable to leave the cell, the cell's natural mechanisms which maintain the electrochemical gradient and fluid balance are activated and sodium channels become more active, drawing the sodium and therefore water into the cell. 

> But as revelatory as this new information was, the implications for treatment were unclear. Besides, cystic fibrosis didn't just affect the lungs' it damaged multiple organs and affected the sweat glands, too. The work was clearly far from done. 

Around the same time and Boucher and Knowles, [Paul Quinton](https://pediatrics.ucsd.edu/research/faculty-labs/quinton-lab/index.html) was also looking for a root cause of CF, although his quest was personal. Quinton had grown up in rural Texas and had self-diagnosed himself as a teenager. While doing his PhD at Rice, Quinton experimented with his *own* sweat on frog cells, although initially promising results were shown to be flukes. Undeterred, Quinton continued his research by doing a postdoc at UCLA. Once again, Quinton used his own body as the material for laboratory experiments. Aware of voltage results from Boucher and Knowles experiments, Quinton replicated the findings with microscopic sweat ducts he had extracted from his own skin cells and healthy controls. Quinton's [further experiments](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6823316/) confirmed that while sodium was able to pass in and out of his sweat ducts, chloride wasn't, suggesting that "this chloride transport defect may be closely associated with the fundamental disturbance in this disease."

> Chloride, everyone now agreed, was the electrolyte causing problems in the nose, lung, sweat glands, and possibly the other organs as well. 

In 1974 Bob Beall (pronounced "bell") had joined the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland. In the US, the NIH is largest funded of medical research, totally around 20% of the total.[[^14]] Beall was attracted by the public policy focus of the NIH and became the director of their Metabolic Disease Program, which at the time was focused on the skyrocketing rates of diabetes. In 1976 Beall reluctantly agreed to scientific meeting about CF (which he had never heard about). Beall was won over by the passion of the small and desperate community who was only able to present a paltry amount of evidence about the disease at the time. But even if Beall wanted to help, nothing could be done until the US Congress directed the NIH to study CF and earmark the appropriate funds. That same year, the NCFRF changed its name to the now-known CFF and launched a lobbying campaign. It was successful, Congress ordered the NIH to look into a study into the future research direction of the disease. 

Over 1977-78 Beall, Tulcin, and the then-president Robert Dresing worked with Beall and other NIH scientists to put together [a report](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pur1.32754081177234&seq=9) *Cystic fibrosis : state of the art and directions for future research efforts.* From a handful of grieving parents raising money through bake sales in the 1950s, within 25 years the CFF had become a national organization with the imprimatur of the NIH and congress. Researchers across the country now would be able to apply for funds to do CF research,

>  ... \[b\]ut grants were for young novice researchers and too small to lure older, preeminent scientists with broad visions. Tulcin and Dresing aimed to build a critical mass of CF science, not a smattering of research here and there. They wanted a network of multidisciplinary centers of excellence, each with a couple of dozen researchers investigating different elements of this complex disease, all sharing data and collaborating. To make this vision a reality and have a shot at curing it would take substantially more funding than Congress would give and more resources that the NIH was willing to devote. If Dresing and Tulcin were going to create this research network.. they needed Bob Beall to launch and lead it. 

The CFF voted to once again move their headquarters, this time to Bethesda, Maryland where they would be right beside the the NIH, and a stones throw away from DC. Beall was poached, and became the foundations director of medicine and science in 1980. He would leave the CFF [35 years later](https://www.cff.org/press-releases/2015-07/cystic-fibrosis-foundation-announces-leadership-transition), having been the president for 21 of those years. Beall and company would plan "a whole new era in CF research--with dozens of research centers devoted to finding a cure." While the handful researchers at each CF center were doing great work to understand CF and its treatments better, Beall was convinced that only a "research agenda equivalent in scope to the one that Harry Weaver had orchestrated for polio" would be able to find a cure. And scope meant money.

Tulcin and Dresing launched a massive fundraising campaign which enabled Beall to approach universities with $500K grants which at the time was a sizable sum. Over 1981-83 three CF research centers were set up at the University of Alabama, UNC Chapel Hill, and UCSF. By 1994 a total of nine were set up in the US, and a over 100 full-time researchers were dedicated on doing basic and applied research that would be aimed at developing treatments for all aspects of CF including the lungs, pancreas, and digestive tract.

## Under the hood

Everyone knew that CF was an autosomal recessive disease, but no one actually knew what gene caused the disease. In 1983, Huntington's disease was found to be on Chromosome 4, making it the first gene to be successfully "mapped." However, gene mapping here merely refers to finding a genetic variant that is highly correlated with the actual disease-causing mutation. This phenomena is known as linkage disequilibrium in genetics, since pairs of co-occurring mutations (that might have arisen in evolutionary history) will be inherited together with a probability inversely proportional to their distance on the same chromosome.[[^15]] 


[Lap-Chee Tsui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lap-Chee_Tsui) was a geneticist who had come to the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in 1981 to join a dedicated CF research team. Like other researchers at the time, Tsui's team was trying to use genetic markers to discover the location of the CF-causing gene by comparing the genetics of patients with and without CF. A seemingly mutually beneficial collaboration with a private sector company called Collaborative Research, Inc. was started in 1984. Collaborative had access to a much larger library of genetic markers that could be used to find CF, and the commercial prospects for testing for CF were immense.[[^16]] 

However, the academic/commercial relationship quickly soured when Tsui realized that Collaborative was holding back its results for fear of letting competitors get a lead. Using Collaborative's markers, Tsui's team discovered that the gene almost certainly was on Chromosome 7. However Collaborative tried to stall the results and Tsui was unable to disclose the discovery. Nevertheless, rumors started spreading that the CF-causing gene was on Chromosome 7 causing other labs around the to pivot. In 1985, Tsui was finally able to publish his results, which had been replicated that same year by two other researchers.[[^17]] Everyone knew the chromosome, but now the gene itself had to be found. This was no small feat given that Chromosome 7 has roughly 159 million base pairs. Randomly selecting a location in the genome would be equivalent to randomly selecting a letter in a book that is roughly 60 times the length of the King James Bible. 

Two years latter, [Dr Williamson's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Williamson_(geneticist)) group claimed to have found the gene, but [the result](https://www.nature.com/articles/326840a0) was soon proven to be erroneous, and instead the group had merely found another marker. Although the (false) result temporarily sent demoralizing shock waves through the labs hunting for the CF gene, the race was quickly revived. What would become the most famous collaboration in the [history of CF research](https://www.cysticfibrosis.ca/blog/the-cystic-fibrosis-gene-discovery-is-a-nobel-prize-worthy-discovery/) began in 1987 when Tsui and [Francis Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Collins) met at the ASHG and agreed to join forces in their hunt for the gene. 

The first solid piece of evidence for the gene's location came at 6pm on May 9th, 1989 when an undergraduate student rushed into Tsui's office and showed him that one CF patient was missing three base pairs, TTC, compared to a healthy patient. This was the F508del mutation. A futher analysis of 50 CF patients showed that 70% of them were also missing this triplet. But Tsui was cautious by nature, and his experience with the Williamson debacle reinforced his view that they needed to have rock-solid evidence before popping the champagne. First, they checked that that the protein this mutation had a shape that could plausible be related to CF. The team's biochemist said indeed it could be a transporter, aligning the protein's form with the findings of Quentin and Boucher. Next they checked the DNA patterns of the parents, and it indeed appeared the F508del mutation followed the exact pattern of an inherited autosomal recessive disease. Lastly, did some statistical analysis showing that this mutation almost certainly had to be the cause of the disease. Tsui was satisfied and christened the gene the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR).

The results sent shock waves through the research community and national media. The result was a triumph of North American collaboration, and (still) forms a foundation of pride for SickKids and UMichigan. The scientific work was split [into](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2772657/) [several](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2570460/) [papers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2475911/). Was a cure now around the corner? Collins and others tried to temper expectations, but a certain giddiness pervaded the community. Shortly after this discovery, CF treatments would reach their [peak of inflated expectations](https://www.gartner.ca/en/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle), only to tumble during 1990s after failed gene therapy treatments. But that would be several years away.  

Still, the finding was astounding. Cystic Fibrosis was the disease to have its disease-causing gene fully sequenced. But the initial discovery was already posing awkward questions. What about the 30% of other CF kids whose 508th amino acid was present? Why didn't all kids have the same mutation. This finding launched one of the most important branches of CF research since 1989: chronicling the menagerie of variants which could lead to the disease. One of the Tsui team members, [Batsheva Kerem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batsheva_Kerem), would go onto show within a few years that the majority of Ashkenazi CF patients actually had a different mutation called [W128X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1682509/). Unlike other mutations which led to a different or missing amino acid, this *nonsense* mutation led to a truncated (and effectively useless) protein. Although it couldn't possibly known at the time, these subtle differences in *why* the CFTR gene was malfunctioning would decades later determine which CF patients would and wouldn't be eligible for treatments.

## Trough of disillusionment

The 1990s was the first era where multiple drug trials were run for the disease. Although the CF community would be in a funk by the end of the 1990s, the decade actually saw several positive developments. First, a diverse coalition of interest groups had lobbied for the Orphan Drug Act of 1983. This piece of legislation increased the returns for Pharma to invest in treating rare diseases by increasing the length of patent protection, waiving various fees, allowing for additional tax deductions, and permitting expedited reviews. 

[Genentech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genentech) was one of the pioneering biotechnology companies of the 20th century. They were the first to show how to mass produce insulin through [recombinant DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA) (basically getting bacterial cells to produce the protein) is temporarily cut open, a new sequence of genetic material (usually a gene) is inserted, and then the plasmid is re-sealed. The bacteria's machinery will then produce the inserted protein for us. The "cutting" and "sealing" of bacterial plasmids is done by restriction enzymes and DNA ligase, respectively. This early genetic engineering allowed for the production of insulin and human growth hormone that revolutionized treatment of these diseases.

Steven Shak was a pulmonologist by training who had left the prospect of an academic career to join Genentech in 1986. Shak had treated CF patients before, and new about [earlier research](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/27/4/589/41175/IN-VITRO-EVALUATION-OF-EFFECT-OF-ENZYMES-ON?redirectedFrom=fulltext) from 1961 had shown a "direct correlation has been shown between the degradation of deoxyribonucleic acid and the decrease in viscosity of the tracheobronchial secretions from cystic fibrosis." In other words, if you get rid of the DNA garbage (caused by all the exploded immune, bacteria, and lung cells), lung cells could become less sticky (viscous). Shak knew that [DNase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyribonuclease#Laboratory_applications) enzyme from cows would cut up DNA and theorized it might help to get rid of the DNA "gunk" in CF patients lungs. After spending many months finding the human (rather than bovine) version of the enzyme and synthesizing it, Shak contacted the Stanford CF center to obtain samples of sputum from pwCF.

When the enzyme was added the results were remarkable, and it wasn't long before Tulcin and Beall came out to see a live demonstration. The CFF was all in, and promised to help with the clinical trial by creating the protocol, identifying the right patients, and engaging CF physicians, as long as Genentech would build the manufacturing capacity for producing DNase at scale. 

The phase III results of the trial came out in [1993](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejm199409083311003) and showed that [pulmonary exacerbations](https://www.cff.org/medical-professionals/pulmonary-exacerbations-clinical-care-guidelines) (PEx) were reduced by 28%. Reducing PEx by a quarter was not world-shattering, but it was significant. The accumulation of PEx over the lifetime of CF patients was what ultimately led to lung deterioration. Furthermore Pulmozyme was arguably the first drug designed to fight a CF symptom, rather than a more general-purpose treatment like antibiotics.

## Gone but not forgotten

It took Bijal Travedi 8 years to write this book. She did hundreds of hours of interviews and must have spoken to countless individuals. One of the most beautiful and charming things in this narrative history is the reference to what must be only a fraction of the amazing stories of pwCF who have contributed to medical advances we see today. When describing the clinical trial of [Pulmozyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dornase_alfa), we learn about [Isabel and Anabel Stenzel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IYlPla7i7Y), two identical twins with CF who were studying at Stanford when they heard about the trial in 1992. Anabel's lung function changed only modestly whilst Isabel's shot up. They knew that the drug worked and that Anabel had received the placebo. These sisters were almost living embodiment of a [potential outcomes model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin_causal_model) in statistics.

## Here and not forgotten

As Rebecca Schroeder in a recent [Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cYdPMGth9Q&t=58s) put it:

> When nearing the end of a race, you don't slow down to admire how close you're getting to the finish line, you step on the gas, you blast through to the end. "Until it's done" means that we won't stop until 100% of people with cystic fibrosis have an effective treatment and a cure. 

As X says in [another review](https://www.n1303k.com/post/beware-the-aggravated-rhinocerus-a-review-of-breath-from-salt) of Bijal's book: 

> Though only a lunatic would deem himself fortunate to have a serious disease like cystic fibrosis arise in his family, I read a story like that and think:  There is something about cystic fibrosis that summons the best in people, and those who are connected to the story of this disease in any way have had something remarkable thrust upon them -- perhaps not a blessing but surely an opportunity that ought not to be squandered.

[^1]: Not only has life expectancy increased in CF, but the most recent pharmacologic gains fundamentally "correct" the underlying disease etiology meaning that symptoms and quality of life improve substantially. Historically, individuals with CF had to engage in daily regimens of physiotherapy, nebulizers, and fistfuls of pills in order to stay healthy (as well as taking proactive measures like avoiding social situations for fear of catching infections).  

[^2]: As of 2023, there are two main lanes of attacking the disease through pharmaceutical interventions. The first is extending the current small-molecule "modulator therapy" approach that has yielded amazing results to many patients to the 5-10% of CF patients who have mutations that do not seem to work with the current approach. The second is actually solving the problem "once and for all" using gene therapy which would require inserting genetic material into the cells which are not producing the CFTR gene they should be producing (e.g. lung and pancreas). Keep reading the post to learn more about the history of gene therapy with CF and why this time might be different. 

[^3]: At the this NACFC conference this year, one speaker suggested that CF was becoming like AIDs, a complex disease that causes many commodities and requires medical expertise to treat, but with the right care plan can give individuals normal lives.

[^4]: There are varying definitions of a rare disease, but in the US, the NIH and FDA consider a disease to be rare if it impacts fewer than 200K individuals in the country (about 1 in 1650 people). 

[^5]: Mutation here can refer to a single point mutation (i.e. one single base pair or "letter" of the DNA being different from what most people have) as well as deletions (most people with CF are missing three side-by-side letters known as the F508del mutation), insertions, and substitutions. 

[^6]: CF also causes the skin to taste salty, although this is not a serious health concern in and of itself except for times of extreme heat when the imbalance of salt in the body can lead to dehydration and heat-related illnesses.

[^7]: Basically once the lung tissue becomes sufficiently scarred and damaged then oxygen will never be able to go through that part of the lungs and patients with CF will slowly lose the ability to breathe. 

[^8]: Around 1/30 Caucasian American adults are carriers for the disease meaning that if they produce a child with another CF carrier, there is a 25% chance that the child will inherit two copies of the "bad" CFTR gene and develop CF. Although interestingly, the variation in outcomes for children with the same CF mutations can be quite different. This could be because of environment factors (like time of diagnosis and treatment quality) or other complex epistatic factors (any studies of this??). 

[^9]: I say the "US" since pharmaceutical companies, both US and non-US ones, derive most of their [revenue](https://pharmanewsintel.com/features/comparing-global-pharmaceutical-markets-the-us-uk-and-china), and likely even more of their profits, from this market. This is partly related to the fact that the US is the largest economy in the world, but even for comparable economies (e.g. the European Union), the US government cannot negotiate drug prices - although this is just beginning to change - so consumers ultimately pay monopoly prices (although technically "payers" like private insurance companies and Medicare/Medicaid pay, they get their money from premiums and tax dollars so the general population pays one way or the other other). There are also all sorts of clever ways the pharmaceutical companies can increase their chance of "winning" at clinical trials (see [Malignant]()) and "[ever-greening]()" their patents, but that is a topic for another day.

Thomas Hunt Morgan was the first to demonstrate with fruit flies that when looking at two traits (caused by different genes), the law of independent assortment [no longer held](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hunt_Morgan#Morgan_and_evolution), and that furthermore, the relative deviation of these probabilities could be used to develop a "genetic map" whereby the distance between genes on the same chromosome could be estimated by their relative phenotypic prevalence in generations of offspring.
