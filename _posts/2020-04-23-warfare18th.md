Given the brutality of war its hard to argue that there was ever a gentlemanly period of armed conflict. Yet if there was to be candidate era, the 18th century may lay a decent claim. During the [Battle of Fontenoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fontenoy) in 1745, the Grenadier guards and the French lines "invited each other to fire first". Yet this romanticized view of European conflict was not representative of most European engagements, which themselves represent a subset of global conflicts. In Jeremy Black's *Warfare in the Eighteen Century*, tries to provide a more balanced history of the era: one told from a European perspective, but highlighting important non-European conflicts too. A reasonable case could be made that military histories of the 19th and early 20th century need to be Eurocentric given the technological dominance available to Western countries. However the firepower advantage possessed by Europeans in the 18th century was modest, and most victories were due to advantages in diplomacy, state capacity, and logistics. Many people know of the [Battle of Plassey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Plassey) and [Robert Clive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Clive), but what about [Third Battle of Panipat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Battle_of_Panipat) and [Ahmad Shah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_Shah_Durrani), that latter being the largest land conflict that occured in 18th century. Many great less-known generals including [Nadir Shah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nader_Shah) who revived the Persian empire and fought battles ranging from Baghdad, the Caucasus, the Aral Sea, and all the way to Delhi.

The 18th century was also when the Chinese state under the [Qing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty) reached its geographic and military apex. Wars of annihilation were fought to crush the [Dzungurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzungar_Khanate]), the last remaining vestiges of the Mongols, and secure the empire's western frontier which ranged from Central Asia to Mongolia to Tibet. China's lack of maritime power meant that it had little conflict with those outside it did not share borders with. Black separates warfare between Europeans and non-Europeans into three categories: battles on European borders (mainly in Eurasia), battles between white settlers and native forces in the Americas, and battles by European armies in territories outside of Europe (i.e. Asian and African colonial wars). Due to a lack of European competition, the 18th Chinese army used weapons that were relatively antiquated including unreliable matchlock rifles and exotic-looking but ineffectual artillery pieces. However the Qing's martial success during this period can be attributed to sophisticated supply lines and outposts in the Western empire. After having dominated warfare for a thousand years, the 18th century would see the end of the efficacy of horse-based military societies threatening Chinese internal security.

Contrary to what might be expected, Europeans fared poorly in military engagements in Asia during the 18th century. The 17th century had established a sense of inevitable colonial momentum when European powers like the Dutch, Portuguese, and French were able to establish toeholds over many Asian, American, and African coastal locations. And during the subsequent century, the use of breech loading rifles, steamships, machine guns, and advances in tropical medicine would allow relatively small numbers of European forces to a massive force multiplier. The 18th century was the beginning of the end of Dutch colonial power, with its forces fighting as series of bitter and indecisive conflicts in the East Indies and Ceylon. The French were driven out of many of their Indian holdings. Furthermore, no European power in the 18th century had any military presence in China, Japan, or Burma. The British were unique in that they obtained significant territorial acquisitions. Although even there, British forces saw defeat at the hands of the [Kingdom of Mysore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Mysore) and were unable to crush the imposing [Maratha Confederacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maratha_Empire). Victories in the Indian subcontinent were largely the native empires failing to unite against the European threat as well as the successful recruitment of local forces as either [sepoys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepoy) or independent cavalry regiments. Like the Spanish conquistadors, achievement was more a function of a unified administrative state and a divided opposition, rather than a divergence in firepower. 

The *Naval Warfare* chapter of the book is inevitably Eurocentric and there were no non-European navies capable of competing with a [ship of the line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_the_line) head-to-head. Ottoman engagements with the Europeans fared poorly during the [Ottoman-Venetian war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman%E2%80%93Venetian_War_(1714%E2%80%931718)) in 1714-18, and then suffered a crushing defeat at the [Battle of Chesme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Chesma) during the Russo-Turkish war of 1764-1774. Once again the British were unique in the 18th century is the consistency of their navel victories (although there were many losses to be clear). What led to British naval success? It was not technology, as Spain, England, Russia, Sweden, and France all copied each other's ship designs and tactics. The British had a better navy because they could afford one. Excellence breeds further excellence: and Britain's navy attracted more competent admirals and institutional memory. The country's relatively stable finances and the lack of need for a large standing army obviated resource constraints of the type seen in France. 

*Warfare* is a relatively short book and has many large and visually engaging maps and paintings throughout. Black writes competently and the book does not feel dry. However in covering so much material, numerous battles, leaders, and regions are made without a corresponding reference being made available (*where is Pondicherry again?*). I would have preferred each chapter to have a series of maps or sidebars that could be used to lookup the places that are being discussed. The American War of Independence receiving its own entire chapter felt inappropriately given that not other specific conflict did. The strongest part of the book remains its balance between writing to a European audience while also discussing many non-European conflicts. If not exactly gentlemanly, warfare in the 18th century was at least more balanced.
