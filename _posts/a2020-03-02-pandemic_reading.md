As I have not had time to write many full-length book reviews I am continuing with my brief [winter reviews](https://bioeconometrician.github.io/winter_reads/). So far 2021 is not producing as many high quality reads as last year unfortunately. There are still many months to go in the year however!

### Book #1: The Dawn Watch by Maya Jasanoff

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/dawn_watch.jpg" width="13%"></p>
<br>

The Korzeniowski's were descendents of the [*Szlachta*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szlachta). 

Didn't appreciate how ingrained Conrad was the English literary establishment.

* Sublet Pent Farm from Ford Madox Ford, who was the nephew of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Christina Rossetti. He worked at Christina's writing table. Henry James lived nearby, as did H. G. Wells, and and Stephen Crane. They all shared the same literary agent: James Brand Pinker.  

He was baffled by his success by the end of his career. Shocked that a short story he thought was blase was earning six times more than his best (literary) novel. 

> *Nostromo* wasn't just Conrad's only novel about a place he'd never been. It was a novel about every place he'd been. It exuded the political cynicism of the Pole who'd seen his parents wrecked by unattainable nationalist ideals. It projected the nostalgia of the man of sail who saw the craft he admired displace by industrial technology. It trembled with the shock and revulsion of the white European who saw values of "civilization" and "progress" turned into weapons of mass destruction in Africa and beyond.

> The secret to *Nostromo's* extraordinary prescience was that Conrad folded between its covers his won "theory of the world's future." In the world to come, the better values that Conrad associated with British power would become obsolete as the romantic dreams of Garibaldi. Instead he anticipated the ascent of an American-led consortium of "material interests." "Material interests" would dictate the fortunes of the new nations. They would make imperialism continue to thrive whether or not it had the word "empire" attached to it. The real question for the world's future, in Conrad's theory, wasn't *what* would happen. It was when and how. 


### Book #2: The Address Book by Deirdre Mask

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/.jpg" width="13%"></p>
<br>

Kevin Lynch, 1952, what makes cities pleasurable? (*The Image of The City*), five components that make up an observer's mental image of a city:

1. paths (streets or walkways)
2. nodes (a junction or crossing)
3. edges (a river or railway track)
4. landmarks (taco shop, distant mountain)
5. districts (Soho, downtown)

Last names are a fairly modern invention, created by the nation state and have a nefarious origin:

> In the United States, federal officials openly despised Native American naming practices, which were often gender-neutral and fluid (Five Bears might become Six Bears ... after a successful hunt) and forced them to change names as part of a grander "civilizing project." Prussia allowed Jews to be citizens in 1812, in exchange for  taking fixed surnames. An edict of 1833 required all Jews, not just those who were nationalized, to take surnames for a list the government chose them, like Rubenstein and Bernstein. But soon after, in 1845, Jews were legally confined to a closed list of surnames, names they could not change, setting them up for effortless identification later by the Nazis.

*Seeing Like a State*. *Paris as Revolution*. *Imaginary Cartographies: Possession and Identity in Late Medieval Marseille*. 

### Book #3: The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy

<br>

### Book #4: Detransition, Baby by Torrey Peters

> \[T\]o have a bos is so commonplace that one rarely remarks on its strangeness, yet its structure compels a cult of personality around even the most quotidian of managers.
