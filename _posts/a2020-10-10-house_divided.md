### Summary

One fact summarizes the dysfunction Toronto's residential real estate market: The GTA has five million empty bedrooms but a vacancy rate of less than 1%. 


There is a debate amongst economists about whether the rate of productivity growth has hit a period of "secular stagnation". For example technologies seem increasingly difficult to create and have fringe benefits. Yet one untapped source economic growth and human flourishing isn't just a piece of low hanging fruit it's practically dangling in front of our faces but is inedible because of political constraints. 


A collection of more than two-dozen short essays about Toronto's dysfunctional housing market, with a specific emphasis on the "missing middle" which refers to duplexes, triplexes, and walk-ups. Also known as "gentle density".

> [D]uplexes and triplexes, the least intrusive of all multi-unit housing types, are not permitted on two-thirds of the entire land mass of Toronto that is designated for residential dwellings. 

There are many ostensible purposes for why zoning is in the public good. One reason given is that it makes cities "liveable"; neighbourhoods where there is a right mix of residential and commercial buildings, with access to parks and good schools. Some of Toronto's most sought after areas are built to a "human" scale of density: duplexes and triplexes, etc. Yet most of these buildings were built before 1952 when Toronto introduced its [first](https://torontopubliclibrary.typepad.com/trl/2015/12/a-brief-history-of-zoning-bylaws-in-toronto.html) zoning bylaw.[[^1]] This problem of regulatory sclerosis is hardly unique to Toronto. Ed Glaeser has shown that, shockingly, average building heights have [declined](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/429979) in Manhattan rather than increased. Not building condos high enough is no Toronto's problem, instead its that 1) condos can only be built on a *tiny* fraction of Toronto's zoned residential land and that 2) you can't even build gentle density on the majority of Toronto's land! 


The origin of this dysfunction is the Official Plan. Several seemingly laudable goals underpins its pathology. The first is the goal of "stability". As John Lorinc points out:

> Toronto's planning policies devote so much rhetorical and regulatory energy to the aspirational virtue of homeowner stability. The latest iteration of the Official Plan makes frequent references to the importance of maintaining 'physically stable' communities, and further refinements adopted in 2015 have put meat on the bones of that policy goal by codifying concepts such as neighbourhood's 'prevailing' character, building heights, lot sizes, and so on. 

What does dysfunctional market look like on the ground for ordinary people? There is Diaz who earns $32K a year and works at Metro. She spends 75% of her post-tax income on housing and though having scraped together $25K for a downpayment has been unable to find any bank who would learn her money to buy a house. A real estate investor buys a two-story home in Scarborough and files a minor variance with the Committee of Adjustment to allow an additional suite, which had already been built previously but was otherwise illegal. Depsite support from the neighbours, the Committee rules against the addition. The house is blocks away from a major road with transit and amenities. The Dymond family have bought a small bungalow in South Etibocoke and are looking to knock down the building and replace it with a three-storey dwelling so that the in-laws can move in after they downsize. A neighbour complains to the Committee of Adjustment and a mediator forces the Dymonds to scale back some their plans. The final cost to the Dymond's of this pointless red tape: $30K per unit development costs and $20K for the park improvement levy, amounting to around a quarter of their purchase price. 

Daniel Rotsztain has a lovely little chapter, *The Mid-Rises of Metropolitan Toronto* where he includes sketches of mid-rise buildings that are unique for their environment. There is 135 Sammon Avenue, three-story building found on a street where the other houses are are single-family detached showing how easily such structures could integrated themselves in the Yellow Belt.

### The Yellow Belt

The Green Belt is a red herring. The origin's of the yellow belt go back to the Toronto Planning Board's 1966 ([condidential](https://archive.org/details/proposalsfornewp00toro_0/page/n3/mode/2up)) *Proposal for a New Plan for Toronto* which created three classifications: improvement areas (where the poor where), areas of private development (where high density development could occur), and areas of stability. It was the first document which stated that "a firm commitment made ... that no basic changes through zoning or other public action which is not in keeping with the character of the area will be allowed for a period of ten years."

De-densification is most prominant in the suburban residences but as Alex Bozikovic points out in *Why Density Makes Great Places, the population of Seaton Village in 1971 was 9,200 whereas it is only 5,600 today. The statistics are truly [horrifying](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/torontos-low-rise-neighbourhoods-losing-density-as-overhousing-spreads/article38285466/). From 2006 to 2016 Toronto added almost 250K new residents but half of all of her neighbourhoods became less dense losing a net population of around 200K. There are more than 2 million empty bedrooms in Toronto. As Anna Kramer put it in *Inside and Outside*:

> This population loss in "stable" neighbourhoods works against all the intensification occurring in growth centres. 

She also made a fascinating point about renovation expenditures. When I was an economist I noticed that renovations had been a growing share of housing.

> Would allowing denser development help? That is difficult to predict precisely. And yet homeowners are already pouring massive amounts of money into renovating their houses in neighbourhoods. If so much investment is going into essentially rebuilding neighbourhoods within the limitations of existing building envelops and footprints, why not add some more units while we're at it? 

There is just literally so much low hanging fruit! 

What the Yellow Belt perversely ensures is that:

> While the demographics of these neighbourhoods have shifted dramatically, their built form has remained frozen in time. Across most of Toronto's suburban residential areas the city does not permit duplexes, triplexes, laneway houses, townhouses, small apartment buildings, shared houses - in fact, any of the categories of home that reflect Toronto's shift to smaller families. 

North York has a population of 656K but there are only 1,400 bachelor units in the city's entire housing stack as of [2019](https://www03.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/hmip-pimh/en/TableMapChart/Table?TableId=2.1.28.3&GeographyId=2270&GeographyTypeId=3&DisplayAs=Table&GeograghyName=Toronto#). This means that a York University student with limited cash would be competing for, at most, 280 apartments that were available (assuming a 20% turnover rate). 

The City of Toronto encompasses 640 square kilometers of land, 50% of which is zoned residential. However "residential" has six zoning categories as the table shows below. A full 200 square km of the total 320km2 of Toronto's residential land is zoned "RD" (or residential detached). Areas like Scarborough, East York, North York, and Etobicoke are all dominated by RD. This area is referred to as the Yellow Belt. Yet even the other designations are misleading. For example an area zoned RM may allow for fourplexes, but if there are no existing dense structures that the "existing character" guidelines in the OP will often prevent even the simplest densification from occuring. 

The costs of the Yellow Belt is green. The suburban areas that prevent development from occurring have [double](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1162/jie.2007.1220) the GHG emissions as do the neighbourhoods with pre-WWII building. 

### History matters

The history of Toronto's hostility towards development draws from its puritanical and WASPy roots. The city's medical officer of Health Dr. Charles Hastings instigated the Toronto Council to pass a bylaw in 1912 to ban apartment's in residential neighbourhoods and to only be allowed on main streets. As the [famous](https://www.blogto.com/city/2014/01/a_brief_history_of_torontos_first_apartment_building) editorial line put it:

> It is a short-cut from the apartment house to the divorce court

The city's social conservationism even extended to affordable housing projects taken up by the Toronto Housing Company, which 'had the taint of charity'. Or consider this gem from *Toronto Daily Star* in 1907 bemoaning that *[I]n the apartment-hotel [the housewife] has absolutely nothing to do, and we all know who provides mischief for idle hands*, [[^X]] to Alderman A. J. Keeler's assertion that *If there is anything destructive of morality and home life it is the herding together of many families under one roof*.[[^Y]]

Gil Meslin does a good job in *A City of Houses* in connecting Toronto's historical antipathy towards density to modern regulations. The 1912 bylaw banning apartments from residential areas created the political legitimacy that "stability" was a valid public policy goal. The 1966 plan talked about "specific areas of stability" while the 1999 Official Plan talked about "reinforcing and enhancing the established physical character," and plus ca change, the 2019 OP talks about "Development... will respect and reinforce the existing physical character of a neighbourhood".  

> Toronto has a long history of antipathy toward apartments. In the years around 1900, when Toronto prided itself on being 'A City of Houses', the arrival of apartments prompted serious pushback from local leaders.
> 
> The language of "stability" and "character" has been used to exclude walk-up apartments and other forms of neighbouhood-scale multi-residential housing from low-rise residential areas for nearly five decades, illustrating how the 1912 prohibition of walk-up apartments on established residential streets has carried over to the present day.


### The Spadina Gardens

I loved Emma Abramowicz story about the Hawes brothers' attempt to build an apartment building at Spadina and Lowther in 1905. Though more than 100 years old, the protagonists and their incentives perfectly capture the issues of Toronto of today. The Hawes', like most developers, were ruthless capitalists. They allowed the local residents to try to buy them out at an inflated price while they surreptitiously bought a lot at the south-east side of the intersection. Their neighbours were the elites of the city and thus were able to martial political pressure against them. This included the City Architect who was concerned that an overhanging bay window would encroach into the public realm by eighteen inches and worried that "there is not telling where we will stop if we let this go". The Hawes' project was stalled while they waited for building permits to be granted by the City Architect's office. The Board of Control recommended a stop-work injunction and the city even cut off the property's water supply. Yet the Hawes' brother would ultimately be successful after appealing the case to Ontario's High Court of Justice. Once again local shenanigans can only be stopped by a higher authority.

### The political economy

Boomer's have perfected the art of kicking away the ladder. They were happy for full-throated capitalism with the Thatcher and Reagan revolutions but have, unconsciously or not, to support policies that enrich themselves at great expense to society. 

Precedents for radical action exist. After WWII a federal wartime order overrode all local zoning restrictions. 

Ed Jackson discusses the *War of the Rosedales* between the powerful local rate payers associations and how they vociferously fought against any apartments going up in their neighbourhood. Basically no gentle density has been added to the area since the 1950s.

The problem is so bad that I found myself sympathetic to authors, like Ana Teresa Portillo and Mercedes Sharpe Zayas, who in their *Urban Legend* piece give sociological analysis of what stable neighbourhoods mean.

> The notion of 'cleansing' a neighbourhood speaks to a white spatial imagination that dreams of a fictional space where stability, stratified wealth, and modern aesthetics coalesce and become understood as a beautification project.

Of course I would never make such a statement myself but I know what they mean! 

Most of the authors could not be described as market urbanists, but their is much sympathy between the camps. Lorinc cites the fact that supply can have an impact on prices, as given evidence by the case of Seattle in 2018, despite the hot labour market and economy.
