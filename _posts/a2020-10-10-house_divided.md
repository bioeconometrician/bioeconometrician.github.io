Toronto is Canada's cultural and economic capitol. The city contains 16% of the country's population, 20% of the its GDP, and 25% of its net job creation. For a young aspiring professional, like myself, moving to Toronto was the obvious career choice. Housing prices being at a higher level in Toronto relative to other Canadian municipalities makes sense given the city's rich amenities and labour market opportunities. But Toronto isn't just more expensive, it's *growing* more expensive. Residential property prices have more than tripled in a 20 year period. As a consequence, the relative price level difference between Toronto and Calgary has grown by 60% during this period. How much of this phenomenon is due to demand issues versus problems in [supply](https://bioeconometrician.github.io/supplymatters)? The publication of *House Divided: How the Missing Middle Will Solve Toronto's Affordability Crisis* will be gladly welcomed by supply-side YIMBY's. The book contains more than two-dozen short essays about Toronto's dysfunctional housing market, with a specific emphasis on the lack of "missing middle" buildings (e.g. gentle density in the form of duplexes, triplexes, and walk-ups).

> [D]uplexes and triplexes, the least intrusive of all multi-unit housing types, are not permitted on two-thirds of the entire land mass of Toronto that is designated for residential dwellings. 

The level of Toronto's property prices and its composition of buildings have been determined as much by market forces as they have by policy decisions. One fact from the book perfectly captures Toronto's dysfunction residential real estate market: the city has millions of empty bedrooms but a vacancy rate of less than 1%. Most Torontonians have a sense that the city is a boom town in construction. This intuition is [erroneous](https://github.com/erikdrysdale/oped/blob/master/gg_starts.png), as fewer housing units were built from 2010-2019 than 2000-09 (on a population-adjusted level). Even though Toronto continuous to have the most [cranes](https://torontostoreys.com/toronto-q3-cranes-index/) in its skyline, most of her neighbourhoods have remained static after decades. The cause of Toronto's strange density distribution is regulation.

### (1) The road the ruin

There are many ostensible purposes for why zoning is in the public good. One reason often given is that it makes cities "liveable". The best neighbourhoods are ones where there is a right mix of residential and commercial buildings, with access to parks and good schools. Toronto's most sought after neighbourhoods are once built to a human scale of density: duplexes, triplexes, and walk-ups. Yet most of these buildings were built before 1952 when Toronto introduced its [first](https://torontopubliclibrary.typepad.com/trl/2015/12/a-brief-history-of-zoning-bylaws-in-toronto.html) zoning bylaw.[[^1]] In markets, it is usually the case that when something is in demand, more of it gets supplied. Why are there so few neighbourhoods with these building types. Answer: it is against city zoning laws to build them.

This problem of regulatory sclerosis is hardly unique to Toronto. Ed Glaeser has shown that, shockingly, average building heights have [declined](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/429979) in Manhattan rather than increased. In Toronto's case, the issue is not that apartment buildings are getting shorter, but rather that 1) condos can only be built on a *tiny* fraction of Toronto's land zoned residential and, 2) gentle density is prohibited from occurring on the majority of Toronto's land! 

The origin of this dysfunction is the Official Plan (OP). Several seemingly laudable goals underpins its pathology. The first is the goal of "stability". As John Lorinc points out:

> Toronto's planning policies devote so much rhetorical and regulatory energy to the aspirational virtue of homeowner stability. The latest iteration of the Official Plan makes frequent references to the importance of maintaining 'physically stable' communities, and further refinements adopted in 2015 have put meat on the bones of that policy goal by codifying concepts such as neighbourhood's 'prevailing' character, building heights, lot sizes, and so on. 

What does dysfunctional market look like on the ground for ordinary people? Consider Diaz, who earns $32K a year and works at the Metro grocery store. She spends 75% of her post-tax income on housing and, though having scraped together $25K for a downpayment, has been unable to find any bank who would lend her money to buy a house. There is the real estate investor who buys a two-story home in Scarborough and files a minor variance with the Committee of Adjustment to allow an additional suite, which had already been built previously but was otherwise illegal. Despite support from the neighbours, the Committee rules against the addition for this house which is otherwise blocks away from a major road with transit and amenities. Then there is the Dymond family that bought a small bungalow in South Etibocoke and are looking to knock down the building and replace it with a three-storey dwelling so that their in-laws can move in after they downsize. A neighbour complains to the Committee of Adjustment and a mediator forces the Dymonds to scale back some their plans. The final cost to the Dymond's of this pointless red tape: $30K per unit development costs and $20K for the park improvement levy, amounting to around a quarter of their purchase price. 


### (2) All roads lead to the Yellowbelt

Toronto's affordability problems have nothing to do with the [Greenbelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenbelt_(Golden_Horseshoe)). Instead, Toronto is constricted from within by the [Yellowbelt](http://www.mapto.ca/maps/2017/3/4/the-yellow-belt), a term referring to the area of Toronto's residential land zoned as "Neighbourhoods" where only low-density houses can be constructed. The term was coined by [Gil Meslin](https://twitter.com/g_meslin/status/787043620406890496) due to its striking visual imagery.

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/yellowbelt.jpg" width="50%"></p>
<p align="center">You can build anywhere that isn't yellow</p>
<br>

The origins of the Yellowbelt go back to the Toronto Planning Board's 1966 [confidential](https://archive.org/details/proposalsfornewp00toro_0/page/n3/mode/2up) *Proposal for a New Plan for Toronto* which created three classifications: improvement areas (where the poor where), areas of private development (where high density development could occur), and areas of stability. It was the first document which stated that "*a firm commitment made ... that no basic changes through zoning or other public action which is not in keeping with the character of the area will be allowed for a period of ten years*."

While the Yellowbelt may be aesthetically pleasing to look at on a map, its has led to an ossified city with catastrophic consequences for affordability and urban life. One [horrifying](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/torontos-low-rise-neighbourhoods-losing-density-as-overhousing-spreads/article38285466/) consequence of the Yellowbelt is that at least half of Toronto's neighbourhoods became less dense from 2006 to 2016. That's right: **half of Toronto's neighbourhoods lost population**. In this same ten year period, Toronto added almost 250K new residents, the population loss from her de-densifying neighbourhoods amounted to around 200K. As Alex Bozikovic points out in *Why Density Makes Great Places*, de-densification is most prominent in the suburban residences. But even areas in the downtown core like [Seaton Village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaton_Village) saw their populations shrink from 9,200 in 1971 to 5,600 today. As Anna Kramer put it in her essay *Inside and Outside*:

> This population loss in "stable" neighbourhoods works against all the intensification occurring in growth centres. 

De-densification is occurring because neighbourhoods which used to comprised of multigenerational households are shrinking. Most of these homes are owned by [Boomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomers) whose children have grown up and whose parents have passed away. The Yellowbelt ensures that, as in the case of the Dymond family, attempts to built multi-story homes to attract new occupants will be prevented. 

> While the demographics of these neighbourhoods have shifted dramatically, their built form has remained frozen in time. Across most of Toronto's suburban residential areas the city does not permit duplexes, triplexes, laneway houses, townhouses, small apartment buildings, shared houses - in fact, any of the categories of home that reflect Toronto's shift to smaller families. 

Kramer's essay also made a fascinating point about renovation expenditures. When I was an economist I noticed that renovation expenditure had become a larger share of residential housing investment over time. In the context of supply restriction which prevent housing types from transforming from low to gentle density, this makes sense.

> Would allowing denser development help? That is difficult to predict precisely. And yet homeowners are already pouring massive amounts of money into renovating their houses in neighbourhoods. If so much investment is going into essentially rebuilding neighbourhoods within the limitations of existing building envelops and footprints, why not add some more units while we're at it? 

The more you examine the numbers, the worse the picture becomes. The city of North York has a population of 656K but contains only 1,400 bachelor units in its entire housing stock as of [2019](https://www03.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/hmip-pimh/en/TableMapChart/Table?TableId=2.1.28.3&GeographyId=2270&GeographyTypeId=3&DisplayAs=Table&GeograghyName=Toronto#). A York University student with limited cash would be competing dozens, at best a couple hundred, apartment units the entire city. The entire City of Toronto encompasses 640 square kilometres of land, 50% of which is zoned residential. However, residential land is broken down into six zoning categories as the table shows below. 

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/zoning_designation.png" width="90%"></p>
<br>

A full 200 square kilometres of Toronto's residential land is zoned "RD" (or residential detached). Areas like Scarborough, East York, North York, and Etobicoke are all dominated by RD. Yet even the other designations are misleading. For example an area zoned RM may allow for fourplexes, but if there are no existing dense structures, then the "existing character" guidelines in the OP will often prevent even the simplest densification from occurring. The costs of the Yellowbelt is green. The suburban areas that prevent development from occurring have [double](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1162/jie.2007.1220) the GHG emissions as do the neighbourhoods with pre-WWII building. 

### (3) History matters

The history of Toronto's hostility towards development draws from its puritanical and WASPy roots. The city's medical officer of Health Dr. Charles Hastings instigated the Toronto Council to pass a bylaw in 1912 to ban apartment's in residential neighbourhoods and to only be allowed on main streets. As the [famous](https://www.blogto.com/city/2014/01/a_brief_history_of_torontos_first_apartment_building) editorial line put it:

> It is a short-cut from the apartment house to the divorce court

The city's social conservationism even extended to affordable housing projects taken up by the Toronto Housing Company, which 'had the taint of charity'. Or consider this gem from *Toronto Daily Star* in 1907 bemoaning that *[I]n the apartment-hotel [the housewife] has absolutely nothing to do, and we all know who provides mischief for idle hands*, [[^X]] to Alderman A. J. Keeler's assertion that *If there is anything destructive of morality and home life it is the herding together of many families under one roof*.[[^Y]]

Gil Meslin does a good job in *A City of Houses* in connecting Toronto's historical antipathy towards density to modern regulations. The 1912 bylaw banning apartments from residential areas created the political legitimacy that "stability" was a valid public policy goal. The 1966 plan talked about "specific areas of stability" while the 1999 Official Plan talked about "reinforcing and enhancing the established physical character," and plus ca change, the 2019 OP talks about "Development... will respect and reinforce the existing physical character of a neighbourhood".  

> Toronto has a long history of antipathy toward apartments. In the years around 1900, when Toronto prided itself on being 'A City of Houses', the arrival of apartments prompted serious pushback from local leaders.
> 
> The language of "stability" and "character" has been used to exclude walk-up apartments and other forms of neighbouhood-scale multi-residential housing from low-rise residential areas for nearly five decades, illustrating how the 1912 prohibition of walk-up apartments on established residential streets has carried over to the present day.

### (4) The political economy

Boomer's have perfected the art of kicking away the ladder. They were happy for full-throated capitalism with the Thatcher and Reagan revolutions but have, unconsciously or not, to support policies that enrich themselves at great expense to society. 

Precedents for radical action exist. After WWII a federal wartime order overrode all local zoning restrictions. 

Ed Jackson discusses the *War of the Rosedales* between the powerful local rate payers associations and how they vociferously fought against any apartments going up in their neighbourhood. Basically no gentle density has been added to the area since the 1950s.

The problem is so bad that I found myself sympathetic to authors, like Ana Teresa Portillo and Mercedes Sharpe Zayas, who in their *Urban Legend* piece give sociological analysis of what stable neighbourhoods mean.

> The notion of 'cleansing' a neighbourhood speaks to a white spatial imagination that dreams of a fictional space where stability, stratified wealth, and modern aesthetics coalesce and become understood as a beautification project.

Of course I would never make such a statement myself but I know what they mean! 

Most of the authors could not be described as market urbanists, but their is much sympathy between the camps. Lorinc cites the fact that supply can have an impact on prices, as given evidence by the case of Seattle in 2018, despite the hot labour market and economy.

### The Spadina Gardens

I loved Emma Abramowicz story about the Hawes brothers' attempt to build an apartment building at Spadina and Lowther in 1905. Though more than 100 years old, the protagonists and their incentives perfectly capture the issues of Toronto of today. The Hawes', like most developers, were ruthless capitalists. They allowed the local residents to try to buy them out at an inflated price while they surreptitiously bought a lot at the south-east side of the intersection. Their neighbours were the elites of the city and thus were able to martial political pressure against them. This included the City Architect who was concerned that an overhanging bay window would encroach into the public realm by eighteen inches and worried that "there is not telling where we will stop if we let this go". The Hawes' project was stalled while they waited for building permits to be granted by the City Architect's office. The Board of Control recommended a stop-work injunction and the city even cut off the property's water supply. Yet the Hawes' brother would ultimately be successful after appealing the case to Ontario's High Court of Justice. Once again local shenanigans can only be stopped by a higher authority.

There is a debate amongst economists about whether the rate of productivity growth has hit a period of "secular stagnation". For example technologies seem increasingly difficult to create and have fringe benefits. Yet one untapped source economic growth and human flourishing isn't just a piece of low hanging fruit it's practically dangling in front of our faces but is inedible because of political constraints. 

Daniel Rotsztain has a lovely little chapter, *The Mid-Rises of Metropolitan Toronto* where he includes sketches of mid-rise buildings that are unique for their environment. There is 135 Sammon Avenue, three-story building found on a street where the other houses are are single-family detached showing how easily such structures could integrated themselves in the Yellow Belt.
