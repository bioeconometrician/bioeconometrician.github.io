In the 18th episode of the [Statistically Insignificant podcast](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/statisticallyinsig/), Jaryd and I discuss the economic rationale behind the carbon tax in Canada, debunk some popular economic misconceptions about it, and analyze why it has become increasingly unpopular and is likely to be scrapped in the next election. Even with hindsight the SIPod boys are only able to identify a few marginal changes the government could have made to increase the long-run popularity of the program, but unfortunately conclude that carbon pricing policies are unlikely to ever be a politically winning strategy in Canada.
