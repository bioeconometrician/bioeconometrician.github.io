There are a rare number of artists whose works appear to be almost *sui generis*. I have in mind El Greco's psychedelic paintings, Mervyn Peake's gothic flights of fancy, or Italo Calvino's post-modern fairy tales as examples. Yet surely C.P. Cavafy[[^1]] deserves to be on the list as well. No description of Cavafy is allowed to begin without reference to E.M. Forster's famous quote describing the man as:

> A Greek gentleman in a straw hat, standing absolutely motionless at a slight angle to the universe.

Cavafy belonged to that class of artist whose identity is inextricably linked to the city in which they their produced their art. Orham Pamuk is another such example.[[^2]] Born in Alexandria in 1863, Cavafy would spend the majority of life in the city. His existence would always be one on margins of society, first as a Greek Orthodox Christian living in the Muslim-majority [state of Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khedivate_of_Egypt), and second as a homosexual. It is not unreasonable to suspect that Cavafy's personal situation explains many of the themes in his poetry including a pervasive sense of loneliness, sexual frustration, and nature of Hellenism.  

*The Collected Poems* of Cavafy span a little more than 200 pages in this Oxford World Classics edition including the introduction and footnotes. This collection also contains the original Greek running side-by-side with the English on the right-hand side of the page. Though I cannot assess the quality of the translation by Evangelos Sachperoglou, there seems to be a large word-for-word overlap when I compared a some of his more famous poems to other translations. While Cavafy wrote many poems over his life, many of which were left unfinished, this work contains the 154 authorized poems that were published. Daniel Mendelsohn's [*Complete Poems*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/218091/complete-poems-by-c-p-cavafy-translated-with-introduction-and-commentary-by-daniel-mendelsohn/) is more likely to of interest for Cavafy scholars.

One thing that is completely lost to the English reader of Cavafy is that he, apparently, made use of both classical and [Demotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demotic_Greek) Greek. This feels appropriate for a poet whose works seamlessly traverse the Greek world from the time Alexander the Great to the 14th century. In one poem we read of the melancholy wedding of Byzantine emperor [John Cantazuzenus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_VI_Kantakouzenos), who dons a fake crown -- the real one having been sold to pay for the empire's debts (*Of Coloured Glass*). In another, we hear of the yearning of [Demetrius Soter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demetrius_I_Soter) to return to Syria only to have his kingdom once again stolen by the false pretender [Alexander Balas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Balas) (*Of Demetrius Soter*). For most Western readers, "Greekness" (i.e. Hellenism) comprises of two discontinuous blocks: the ancient Greek world of Homer and Pericles, and then after a 2000 year gap, the revival of the Greek nation state after independence for Ottoman control. In contrast, Cavafy's sense of Hellenism is more akin to Judaism: an unbroken cultural chain that was preserved through the [Alexandrian kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diadochi) and the Greek colonies from Asia Minor to Alexandria. While Greek power went into decline after the [Battle of Actium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Actium) when Ptolemaic Egypt was conquered by Imperial Rome, Greek culture was preserved in the Eastern Roman Empire through the [Byzantines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire). Even after the fall of Constantinople, Greeks continued to have a unique identity and role throughout the Ottoman empire, mainly as the merchant class. Greeks were also in charge of Christian spiritual affairs, with the [Phanariot Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phanariots) controlling the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Until the 1920s, Greeks were a large minority in Turkey, although the tragic ["population exchanges"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_exchange_between_Greece_and_Turkey), more akin to ethnic cleansing, destroyed communities that were a thousand years old. The Greek community in Alexandria felt the same way as the Greeks living in [Smyrna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smyrna) did to their Hellenistic identity. It is interesting to note that Cavafy only travelled to Greece once in his life, and that was to receive treatment for his laryngeal cancer. 


### *The City*

The city of Alexandria conjures up the glories of the past: Alexander the Great (of course), the [Ptolemies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_Kingdom), Caesar and Cleopatra, [Callimachus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callimachus), and the [eponymous library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria). Yet the Alexandria of Cavafy's life was many centuries past its glory. Cairo had had displaced Alexandria as the administrative capital of Egypt after Ottoman annexation. Much like Venice today, those living in Alexandria had to contend with the city's glorious past in relation to its contemporary provincial insignificance. 

> You said: 'I'll go to another land, I'll go to another sea.
> Another city will be found, a better one that this.
> My every effort is doomed by destiny
> and my heart--like a dead man--lies buried.
> How long will my mind languish is such decay?
> Wherever I turn my eyes, wherever I look,
> the blackened ruins of my life I see here,
> where so many years I've lived and wasted and ruined.'
>
> Any new lands you will not find; you'll find no other seas.
> The city will be following you. In the same streets
> you'll wander. And in the same neighbourhoods you'll age,
> and in these same houses you will grow grey.
> Always in this same city you'll arrive. For elsewhere--do not hope--
> there is no ship for you, there is no road.
> Just as you've waster your life here,
> in this tiny niche, in the entire world you've ruined it.

Perhaps Cavafy found this inescapable geographic identity as somewhat of a relief given his personal circumstances: confined to his Alexandrian prison he could live in the past. And not just the triumphant past of Periclean Athens or Imperial Rome but on the margins of antiquity; of forgotten Byzantine emperors and Syrian kings. 

### Political organization

For readers with a more analytical mindset... 

In *Waiting for the Barbarians*...

> And now, what will become of us without barbarians?
> Those people were some sort of a solution.


*In a Large Greek Colony, 200 B.C.*

Could this reference the European control of Egypt's finances?

> That the affairs in the Colony are not going well
> not the slightest doubt remains,
> and though somehow or other we are moving along,
> perhaps, as many believe, the time has come
> to bring in a Political Reformer.
>
> But the obstacle and the difficulty is,
> that these Reformers make
> a great issue out of everything.
> (A blessing it would be if nobody
> ever needed them.) They examine
> and inquire about the slightest little thing,
> and they set their mind immediately on radical reforms,
> demanding that these be executed without delay.
> 
> And when, in good time, they complete their assignment,
> and having specified and reduced everything down to the last detail,
> they depart taking away their rightful wages,
> then let us see what else is left
> after such surgical dexterity.
> 
> Well, possibly the time may not, as yet, be ripe.
> Let's not be hasty; rashness is a hazardous thing.
> Untimely measures foster regrets. To be sure,
> there is, unfortunately, a lot that's out of place in the Colony.
> But is there anything human devoid of imperfection?
> And, well, one way or another we are moving along.

### Classical signalling

*Philhellene*

> See to it the engraving be skilfully done.
> The expression serious and dignified.
> The diadem preferably rather narrow;
> those broad Parthian ones are not to my liking.
> The inscription, as usual in Greek;
> nothing excessive, nothing pompous--
> lest the proconsul, who always pokes around
> and reports to Rome, take it the wrong way--
> but nonetheless, of course, honorific. 
> Something very special on the other side;
> some handsome youth, a discus-thrower
> Above all, I bid you pay attention
> (Sithaspes, in god's name, don't let this be forgotten)
> that after the words 'King' and 'Saviour'
> be engraved in elegant lettering: 'Philhellene.'
> And now don't start your witticisms on me,
> like: 'where are the Greeks' and 'where is Greek used
> around here, this side of Zagros, way beyond Fraata.'
> Since so many others, more barbarous than we,
> write it, we will write it too.
> And finally, do not forget that on occasion
> there comes to us sophists from Syria,
> and poetasters and other pretentious pedants.
> Thus, we are not lacking in Greek culture, I do believe. 

*For Ammones, Who Died Aged 29, in 610*

> Raphael, they want you to compose a few verses
> as an epitaph for the poet Ammones.
> Something polished and in good taste. 
> You can do it, you are the apporpriate person to write
as befits the poet Ammones, our very own.

> You must, of course, mention his poems--
> but your should also speak about his love of beauty,
> his delicate beauty we loved.

> Your Greek has always been elegant and musical.
> But we're in need of your entire skill now.
> Our love and our sorrow pass into a foreign tongue.
> Pour your Egyptian feeling into the foreign tongue.

> Raphael, your verses must be written in such a weay
> that they contain, you know, something in them of our lives,
> that both cadence as well as every phrase denote,
> that an Alexandrian is writing about an Alexandrian.

### Echoes of Tennyson

*Supplication*.

> The sea took a sailor into its depths.--
> His mother, unware, goes to light
>
> a tall candle before the Virgin Mary,
> that he return soon and meet with fine weather--
>
> all the while turning windward her ear.
> But as she prays and supplicates,
>
> the icon listens, solemn and sad, well aware
> that he'll never come back, the son she awaits.

To me has clear connections to Tennyson's Canto VI of In Memoriam.

> O mother, praying God will save
> Thy sailor,—while thy head is bow'd,
> His heavy-shotted hammock-shroud
> Drops in his vast and wandering grave.

*Kleitos' Illness*

Though the icon of *Supplication* is mute and sympathetic, the dark demon is not.

Kleitos, a likeable young man,
about twenty-three years old--
with excellent upbringing and rate Greek learning--
is gravely ill. He caught the fever
that swept through Alexandria this year.

And an old servant woman who had raised him
is trembling too for the life of Kleitos.
Deep in her terrible distress,
an idol comes to her mind, which she worshipped
as a girl, before she entered there, a servant
in the home of prominent Christians, and converted.
She discretely takes some unleavened cakes, wine and honey.
She puts them before the idol, intoning those chants
of supplication she still remembers: bits and pieces. The fool!
She doesn't realize that the dark demon couldn't care less
whether a Christian were to get well or not.


*Come Back*

> Come back often and take hold of me,
> beloved sensation, come back and take hold of me--
> when the memory of the body is aroused,
> and past desire flows into the blood again;
> when the lips and the skin remember,
and the hands feel as it they are touching again.
>
> Come back often, and take hold of me in the night,
> when the lips and the skin remember.

Feels like and the erotic counterpart to Canto L:

> Be near me when my light is low,
> When the blood creeps, and the nerves prick
> And tingle; and the heart is sick,
> And all the wheels of Being slow. 


### Christianity

*Myres: Alexandria, A.D. 340*

Cavafy's longest poem. Many poems about Julian the Apostate and the early Christian church.

We knew, of course, that Myres was a Christian.
We knew if right from the start, when
he joined our group of friends two years ago. 
But he led his life exactly as we did.
More given to sensual pleasures than nay of us,
squandering his money lavishly on amusements.
Oblivious of his reputation in society,
he threw himself readily into nocturnal street-brawls,
when our group of friends chanced
to encounter a hostile company.
He never spoke about his religion.
As a matter of fact, we told him once
that we'd take him with us to the Serapeum,
but he appeared displeased
with this little joke of ours: I remember now.

And suddenly I was overwhelmed by an eerie
awareness. Vaguely, I felt
as if Myres was drifting away from me;
I felt that he, a Christian, was being united
with his own kind, and I was becoming
a stranger, a total stranger; I could already feel
a certain ambivalence closing in: was it possible I'd been misled
by my passion, that I had always been a stranger to him?--
I hastened out of their dreadful house;
I left in a hurry, before their Christianity could snatch away,
before it could distory the memory of Myres.
