In episode 11 of the [Statistically Insignificant podcast](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/statisticallyinsig/) Jaryd and I are joined by our friend Steve Bank for a wide ranging discussion philosophy, economics, politics, and much more. Intellectually peripatetic, Steve takes us on a journey through many domains during this interesting conversation.
