In the 15th episode of the [Statistically Insignificant podcast](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/statisticallyinsig/) Jaryd and I are joined by Rachel McMullan, an Osteoarchaeologist by training with an expertise in Near Eastern and Classical archaeology. In this fascinating conversation, Rachel talks about her career in archaeology, why digs are more pleasant in England than Canada, clarifies (to me) that Boudica was indeed a real person, and discusses the content creation process of her YouTube channel (and much more). Rachel currently works as a Digital Marketing Executive, and interested listeners can follow her on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Rachelamun_Archaeologist) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dancingtrowel).
