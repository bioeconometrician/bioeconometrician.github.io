In episode 6 of the [Statistically Insignificant podcast](https://statisticallyinsignificant.sounder.fm/show/statistically-insignificant) Jaryd and I have a wide ranging discussion about the [2020 Tory Leadership Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Conservative_Party_of_Canada_leadership_election) and other issues around Canadian politics and international affairs. The episode highlight is surely when Jaryd uses his inductive skills to accurately map all campaign slogans to candidates from inferring the use of punctuation.
