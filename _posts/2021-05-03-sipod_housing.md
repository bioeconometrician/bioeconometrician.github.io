In episode 9 of the [Statistically Insignificant podcast](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/statisticallyinsig/) Jaryd and I are joined by  Cory Matthews (@coryfmatthews) a Real Estate Investor and Realtor with [Lifestyle Homes](lifestylehomes.realestate). This episode is 100% about the Canadian housing market. Cory discusses some of the market's issues and highlights vulnerabilities that buyers and investors should be aware of. 

I am curious to see how this episode will sound in a year from now too!
