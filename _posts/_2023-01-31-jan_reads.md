### Book #X: Babel - An Arcane History by R. F. Kuang

> Annthony laughed gently. 'Do you think abolition was a matter of ethics? No, abolition gained populatriy because the British, after losing America, decided that India was going to be their new golden goose. But cotton, indigo, and suagr from India weren't going to dominate the market unless Frances could be edged out, and France would not be edged out, you see, as long as the British salve trade was making the West Indies so very profitable for them.
> ... 'Ther abilitionist movement you know is a lod of pomp. Rhetoric only. Pitt first raised the motion because he saw the need to cut off the slave trade to France. And parliament go on board with the abolionists because they were so very afriad of Black insurrection in the West Indies.'
>
> 'Well, not necessarily. Your brother likes to argue that the Jamaican slave revolt, failed though it was, is what impeelled the British to legistlate abolition. He's right, but only half right. See the revolt won British sympathy because the leaders were part of the Baptist church, and when it failed, proslavery whites in Jamaica started destroying chapels and threning missionaries. Those Baptists went back to Engalnd and drummed up support on the grounds of religion, not natural rights. My point being, abolition ahappened because whiet people found reasons to care - whether those be economic or religious. You just have to make them think they came up with the idea themselves. You can't appeal to their inner goodness. I have never met an ENglishment I truested to the right thing out of sympathy. 

> Robin wondered then howm uch of Anthony's life had been spent carefully translating himself to white people, how much of his genial affable polish was an artful construction to fit a particular idea of a Black mani n white ENgland and to afford himself maximum access within an instituion like Babel. And he wondered if there would ever be a day that came when all this was unncessary, when white people would look at him and Anthony and simply listen, when their words would have worth and value because they were uttered, when they would not have to hide who they were, when they wouldn't have to go through endless distortions just to be understood. 

### Book #Y: Rules of the Wild by Francesca Marciano

Referring to Africa:

> It's a big flea market; sometimes we come to sell and sometimes to buy. WHen you first came here you felt fresh and new, everybody around you was vibrant, full of attention, you couldn't imagine ever getting user to this place. It felt so foreign and inscrutable. You so much wanted to be part of it, to conquer it, survive it, put your flag up, and you longed for that feeling of estrangement to vanish. You wished you could press a button and feel like you had been here all your life, knew all the roads, the shops, the mechaniics, the tricks, the names of each animal and indiginous tree. To blend in like a chameon, join the group and be accepted for good. Didn't want to be investigated. Your past had no meaning; you only cared about the future.
>
> Obviously, you were mad to think you could get away with it without paying a price.

Referring to Claire:

> She has never lived here before, but she is coming to stay for good. She will eventually learn all the rules and turn into another specimen, like all of us. That is what everyone has to learn in order to survive here. 

Referring to her ex:

> There is a vast tribe of men like P., who manage to live all their lives within their self-imposed boundaries, and are perfectly resigned never to cross them.
> 
> They are uncomfortable at the mere idea of having to out in the open: in fact they don't even seem to be capable of getting out of their own clothes with ease. They seem perptrually sealed in their Brooks Brothers shirts, even when they are naked and breathing heavily on top of you. Nothing will change them, not death, nor diaster, not war, nor a broken heart. But the saddest part is that beautfy will not change them either. THey can't take it in, let alone open up to it. They are perpturally spectators. They just take pictures.


### Book Z: better by Atul Gawande

> What makes the wide variability especially puzzling is that our system for CF care is so much more sophisticated than that for most other diseases. CF care works the way want all of medicine to work. Patients receive care in one of the 117 ultraspecialized centers across the country. All centers undergo a rigorous certification process. Their doctors have a high volume of experience in caring for people with CF. They all follow the same guidelines for CF treatment, guidelines that are far more detailed that we have in most of medicine. They all parcipate in research trials to figure out new and better treatmetns. You would think, therefore, that their results would be much the same. Yet the differences are enormous. 

> I had gone there \[India\] thinking that, as an American-trianed surgeon, I might have a thing or two I could them them. But the abilities of an average Indian surgeon outstripped those of any Western surgeon I know. 
>
> "What is your preferred technique for removing gall bladder stones?" one surgeon in the city of Nagpur asked me. 
>
> "My technique is to call a urologist," I said.

<br>

Words 

"Jesus Cover Up Thesis", Paul and James led two different religions. Luke/Acts made up an imaginary Jeruselum conferences of XXAD, which made it seem like there was one religion. This provides a "clean" explaination for the old vs new testament.

Pauline Christianity is about what Jesus was, rather than what he did. 

A lot of silly outrage. By what right did Paul usurp the prophets?!

Great irony an anti-Roman imperialist insurrection becomes the religion on the empire.
