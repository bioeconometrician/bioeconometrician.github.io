In the 13th episode of the [Statistically Insignificant podcast](https://statisticallyinsignificant.sounder.fm/show/statistically-insignificant) Jaryd and I are joined by Elizabeth Cook who works as an Economist and Policy Analyst at the Department of Finance in Ottawa. Elizabeth is an expert in tax policy. In this interesting conversation Jaryd and Erik receive a crash course in what it is like to work at the Finance and how the budget is put together. Elizabeth also talks about the skillset that economists need to work in the civil service and what it's like to be a self-publishing author.

Elizabeth keeps a [blog here](https://serialoutlet.wordpress.com/).
