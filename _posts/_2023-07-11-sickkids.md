## Introduction and origins

The history of medicine closely resembles the history of the modern world. The statistical reliability of human illness means that social trends inevitably rub off on medicine, since all strata of society come intact contact with its services. As Susan Sontag put it "everyone who is born holds dual citizenship, in the kingdom of the well, and in the kingdom of the sick." Advances in medicine shape our perception of the natural world and the nature of progress. Our understanding of what medicine can do, who should receive its healing powers, and where this should all take place have changed remarkably in the last 150 years. No institution better captures this evolution that the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto (HSK), called affectionately ["sweetest of all charities"](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/16252).


[David Wright's](https://www.mcgill.ca/history/david-wright) SickKids: The History of The Hospital for Sick Children is a magisterial account of how Toronto's pre-eminent paediatric institution was founded, evolved and settled into its current status as a world-renowned centre for [medical care](https://www.newsweek.com/worlds-best-specialized-hospitals-2022/pediatrics) and research. Before the discovery of antibiotics and modern obstetrics, being young was much more dangerous than being old.[[^1]] In modern parlance, medicine has been for most of human history a problem of *acute* rather than *chronic* care. When SickKids was founded in 1875 in an 11-room house, medical care for children was mainly thought to be in terms of the salubrious effect of spiritual uplift and middle class manners.

As is clear in reading the hospital's first [first annual report](https://www.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.8_00322_1/1), the hospital's mandate was largely spiritual.

> The hospital is supported by contributions VOLUNTARY, in the fullest sense of the word. And, as there is no canvassing for funds, friends will kindly send such subscriptions as there generous hearts, guided by God's Spirit, may prompt... \[s\]uch an Institution was to be opened in full dependence upon God alone for its support.

Such religious fervour seems alien to our society now, especially in the context of medicine. Yet Wright's skill as a historian throughout this book is to remind us of relevant social trends and ideas of the age. The evolution of the hospital as an institution provides a useful example as to how English-speaking Canada slowly shed its white-British cultural hegemony as Canadian society became more pluralistic and racially heterogeneous. 

In the Victorian Ontario, hospitals were seen as places for poor children to die at worst, or recover in the presence of sunlight and spiritually virtuous women at best. Undoubtedly Dicken's novels published in the middle of the 19th-century -- Oliver Twist (1837), A Christmas Carol (1843), Bleak House (1852) -- contributed to the idea of the deserving and innocent child, left defenceless due to the cruelties of the industrial system and missing parents. And while orphans were an obvious example of children in need of social assistance, physically handicapped children were also seen as especially deserving of care.[[^2]] 

For physicians, hospitals like SickKids were especially appealing since specialized medicine was seen both as a route for scientific advance and a way to formalize their monopoly of "real medicine." Given that the era was full of fly-by-night quacks and snake oil potions, there was certainly a public interest argument to be made that the profession should become more regulated and closed off. As will be shown throughout the history of the HSK, the medical professions desire for monopoly and control would exert itself many times again with less socially beneficial results. 

The stated justification for the HSK in the 1875 report seems simple enough - "A special Hospital for Children is needed, because the proper care of sick children require special arrangements." Yet the quotes it draws on from (British) medical men is revealing as to the range of viewpoints that Victorian medicine had for the treatment of sick children.

* "I will venture to say that the poor, as a class, will gain more from the establishment of a Hospital for Children’s Diseases, than they would from any General Hospital." ([Dr. Latham](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Ormerod,_Edward_Latham)) 
* "The proposal to establish a Hospital for Sick Children is a measure so fraught with prospective benefits to every class of the community, that I cannot but regard it with deep interest and solicitude." ([Sir George Burrows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_George_Burrows,_1st_Baronet)) 
* "The establishment of a Children’s Hospital, while proving an inestimable boon to themselves and their distressed parents, must also tend greatly to the advancement of medical knowledge in this important department of infantile diseases." ([Sir John Forbes](https://www.clan-forbes.org/people/Sir-John-Forbes-MD)) 

Latham shows the traditional view of hospitals as places for the poor to die (which goes back the Georgian hospitals in England in the 18th century). Burrows' more modern take notes the opportunities across all classes, an idea which was informed by the growing power of medicine and specialized practice. Lastly Forbes' highlights that the benefits to children and families will be equally matched by the contributions to science - a perhaps not-so-subtle suggestion that the misery of illness may prove a boon to future generations. 

> The establishment of specialist hospitals, therefore, cannot be seen narrowly as merely a response to some pre-existing demand that operated in society at large. Rather, the emergence of Great Ormond Street and other children's hospitals needs to be understood as a complicated interaction between the epidemiological reality of nineteenth-century society, a new view of childhood, and the aspirations of groups of medical practitioners eager to carve out a professional niche. The process was thus reciprocal and interactive. Children's hospitals would shape the attitudes of families and communities towards the need for institutionalization and specialist care; in turn, the medical and surgical challenges of children with ill health or disabilities would inform how these hospitals would develop, whom they would admit, and whom they would exclude. Medical staff working in these new children's hospitals would publish medical texts and clinical papers on the diseases of children, all engendering and validating the specialist care in the first place and reinforcing the trend towards specialization.

Due to Florence Nightingale's pioneering work at establishing the modern practice of nursing, middle-class women were attracted to working (or volunteering) at hospitals like SickKids. Leading up to the second war and shortly thereafter, SickKids was (literally) powered by the volunteer or low-pay efforts of women. Many of whom where grateful for the quasi-career opportunities it provided them. The power imbalance between the male (mainly doctors) and female (nurses and volunteers) would be a constant element of tension at the HSK, blowing up most famously with the trial of [Susan Nelles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_hospital_baby_deaths) and later commissions. 



* Protestant groups ran most of the charities, but half of their recipients were Catholic. The Catholic Bishop Charbonnel created a parallel set of charities to allay worries about proslytising and discrimination. This is what Toronto's St. Michael's Hospital was created.

> Thew new context of moral reform necessitated that gorups striving to "save the social" id not wish to simply meet the material need sof the poor, but also to improve the moral chraacter of those who received aid.
> 
> A central theme in Protestant charitable activity in this period was thurd a tension - amost a psychological angst - between the preceive Chirstian duty to aid the poor and a persistent fear of "proiscuous giving". How could one truly distinguish between the descrving and the disingenuous? To add to the uncertainy, itw as  beliveid that the most worthy recipients were those who were most relectuant to seek aid, which occasionally made middle-class philanthorpists suspicious of those who availaved thesmselves too easily of assitance. 

* John Ross Robertson was SickKids most important early patron. One contemporary named him an "irascile philantrhopist" and "the grand crank of belevolence" proclaiming that "absolutely and petulantly impressive, totally democratic and simple, biotedly a friend of the people, and always favourtable to a rumpus - this self-engedered interpreter of a restless democracy never could have been conventionally cribbed in a common sanctum."

> Over the fifteen years between the opening of the new hospital in 1891 and the establishment of the pediatric specialty of orthopaedics at the UNniverstiy of Toronto (in 1906), surgery had become the defining image of the new hospital of College Street. SUrgical success stories dominated the hospital's pulbic appeals for support, the the ubiquitous "before and after" photosgraphs transforming public sensibilities of what could be achieved through the miracles of scientific medicine. This domincacnce of orthopaedic surgey was transatlantic. Grend Ormond Street, Boston Children's, and Children's Hopsital of Philedelphia were likewise becoming known for their orhopaedic work. Orthopedic surgery alterated not only the self-image of the children's hospital ath the turn of the cejtury, it also affected popular attritudes to disability - to the "crippled child." Crippled children became the objects of charities that sought to render them "useful and independent." 

SickKids was situated in The Ward, which become the main place for Toronto's Jewish community (68% Jewish in 1911 census). Meaning SickKids had a special relationship with the Jewish community, which largely positive had a dark vein in the unofficial ban on the hiring of Jewish doctors or nurses (hence the ultimate creation of Mount Sinai).


> The establishment of The Hospital for Sick Children in 1875 reflected a fascinating intersection of charity, religion, and medicine that informed late Victorian Canadian society.

## The era of scientific medicine


SickKids was on the cutting edge of research into infant nutrition. Most famously Frederick Tisdall's Pablum (double check). From the 1920s to 1940s there were also quite a few female research scientists which was very rare for the era. There was also Tisdall's biscuits that used the recently discovered process of irradiation to add vitamins to food products. 


> By the 1920s the public's mood had shifted towards the idea that children's medical care should be publicly funded, parrly due to the view of children as being innocent but also some quasi-eugenics ideads about children being fit for mitiltary service. While the public fund contributions grew, there were still huge gaps that were plugged by private financing. And who should pay for all the "out of towners"? Hamilton, London, etc. The "bad debts" of SickKids were a PR nightmare that needed to handled delicately. Most often they were written off, but sometimes the engagement of collectors and solicitors was pursued. Some parents refused to pay because their kids never got better. Others just disappeared. And then there of course were "Indian" children, who were supposed to be covered by the federal government. 

* Thistletown expansion in Etibocoke: "Many of those children had known in their homes povertt and sickness, and even harshess and cruelty... at the Hospital fo sick CHildren they were given strength to overcome the noxious environment from which they came."

> The negotiations, however, were not just about swapping key preoperties along the prime downtown real estate of Unniverstiy Avenue in Toronto. Discussions suggest a more subtle and unusual quid pro quo. The board members of Mount Sinai were indeed intent on building a new hospital in the city centre. But more imporant to them than the actual location was that the hospital be affiliated to the University of Toronto as a teaching hospital. It appears that the board saw The Hospital for Sick CHildren as a sympathetic ally, one which could be straeticallyl useul in the face of the hostile medical staff at the Toronto General HOspital (who occupied many of the senrio medical appointment at the Universtiy of Toronto Medical School).

SickKids got the property in exchange for  a commitment of support that the future ount Sinai would be a teaching hospital with UofT. The Nazi attrocities helped Ontario to decide it was time to put the embarrassing anti-Semitic interwars years behind it.

> As a consequence, certain provicnial politicians leaned on senior members of the TGH to relent in their opposition of a guture Mount Sinai being affiliated to the universit's medical school. Ultimately the gambit worked. SickKids acquired their targery property, Mount Sinai received a lot across the  street, and the new Jewish hospital would become affiliated to the UofT. Quite apart from the dascinating political negotiations, this chapter left a remarkable physical legacy to the city, with three of the largest hospials in the entire country coexisting literally on adjacent blocks. 

> Stakeholders at the UofT lobbied effectictively against the proposal to create a new medical school at York University. 

Instead it went to Hamilton (McMasters). This further entrenched the view that SickKids would also protect its monopoly. ALthough its insistence that the bed numbers be capped at 600-800 to preserve its reputation and academic excellence would require offloading care on non-pediatric hospitals throughout Toronto as the city's population grew.
