In episode 4 of the [Statistically Insignificant podcast](https://statisticallyinsignificant.sounder.fm/show/statistically-insignificant) I am joined by Karina Isaev who works as a computational biologist at the [Princess Margaret Cancer Centre](http://kridel-lab.ca/Team/). Karina provides an excellent overview of her research topics and their relevance to cancer biology.

### Show notes

1. Karina's academic publications can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=q5Hzub8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra)
2. Influence of microbiome on [immunotherapy response](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6371/91?refcode=Futurism20)
3. A better understanding of the molecular basis for how [Gleevec](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/gleevec-the-breakthrough-in-cancer-treatment-565/) works to provide a targeted therapy for CML
4. [Kazakhstan](tourism Khazakstan) is underrated
5. [Eric Topol](https://twitter.com/EricTopol) and [Frank Harrell](https://twitter.com/f2harrell) are good resources to follow on Twitter
6. Yes, the Brexit vote was considered a phenotype in a [GWAS](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/457515v1) study
7. In case you were wondering, Karina's band was called [Astrolab](https://astrolabband.bandcamp.com/); we look forward to their return tour
