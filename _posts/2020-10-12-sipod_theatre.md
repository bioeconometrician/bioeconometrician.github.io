In episode 7 of the [Statistically Insignificant podcast](https://statisticallyinsignificant.sounder.fm/show/statistically-insignificant) Jaryd and I interview Jasmine Knox, a Production Manager, and an expert on the theatre industry in Toronto. We learn from Jasmine the many challenges that the theatre has experienced since the onset of COVID-19 along with what it is like to work in the sector. I learned a lot from this interview and I hope listeners will as well.
