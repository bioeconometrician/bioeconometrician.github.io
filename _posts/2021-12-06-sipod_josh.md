In episode 12 [Statistically Insignificant podcast](https://statisticallyinsignificant.sounder.fm/show/statistically-insignificant) Jaryd and I are joined by [Joshua Zachariah](https://brookfieldinstitute.ca/team/joshua-zachariah/), an economist who works at the Brookfield Institute of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, a think tank, in Toronto, Canada. Joshua’s main research interest is in better understanding how gains from the innovation economy can be more equitably shared. Joshua has a background in economics and has worked for the Ontario public service and the private sector. In this episode we discuss the innovation economy in Canada, and Joshua’s view about economics and econometrics more broadly.
