In most areas of economic activity we are better at doing things today then we were 20, 50, and certainly 100 years ago. In today's economy we can produce more food than we can eat with only X% of the population, auto mobiles that last for 20 years and get y miles per gallon, and synchronize organ transplants across the country. FIRST SKYSCRAPER NEW YORK, AUTO-LOCK ELAVATOR ... the market for residential property must surely be similar. Yet somehow we have forgotten how to build housing units that a middle class family can afford to live in. One thing we are better at doing is enabling households to borrow increasingly larger sums of debt relative to their incomes. 

Toronto is described as a city of high-rises and condos. One [commonly hears](https://building.ca/toronto-continues-to-lead-north-america-in-crane-index/)	 that "Toronto's skyline has the most number of cranes in North America". Yet this view is highly misleading. Toronto is actually a dichotomous city, with areas small portions of land having 50-story skyscrapers (like Liberty Village) while the vast majority of the city is exclusively zoned for single-family homes. Toronto is neither a city of skyscrapers like Singapore nor a dense low-rise city like Paris. An aerial view of Toronto makes this very clear. We have a problem of the missing middle: "townhouses, triplexes, fourplexes, walk-up apartments, and the creative combinations in between."

And a full third of condo completions occur in the city (REF). Yet these changes are a drop in the bucket. X thousand completions represent a pitiful Y% of the housing stock in the city. When house building is compared to Toronto's economic growth and job growth, and house price acceleration these numbers become pitiful. It's important to note that this a self-inflicted wound. "We" have decided that most residential areas [will have not apartments](https://tinyurl.com/y5gt7qmx), even the low- to mid-density ones. It's important to [remember](https://tinyurl.com/yb8l3uf8) that *"approximately 70 per cent of Toronto's residential areas ... is zoned for detached and semi-detached housing that sells for $1 million-plus on average"*. This [area](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/960b-City-Planning-Zoning-city-wide-Residential-zone-map.pdf) is known as the "yellow belt".

The vision of wide-spread "affordable housing" in the style of a country like Austria (REF) is infeasible in Canada's litigious decentralized urban environment. Dealing with zoning regulations can sometimes approach [soviet](https://tinyurl.com/ydeojy3m)-like levels of bureaucracy. 

The battle of housing is not just a legal and economic one, it will involve a cultural shift. If  Canadian society it is socially unacceptable to say you oppose a school zone re-districting because your children will have to attend school with poor or ethnic minorities. That would be classist and racist. But if you are the most famous novelist from Canada and [you oppose](https://tinyurl.com/ya2yxknn) a new building in your multi-million dollar downtown suburb because of concern for your neighbours "trees".

YIMBY'ism will win when "neighbourhood" preservation is treated with the same distate as coloured water fountains.

WHAT ARE THE PROPERTY TAX RATES LIKE RELATIVE TO TORONTO??

Sean Galbraith says of Toronto: "If it's not already there, you can't build it."

As have been previously [noted](https://tinyurl.com/y9c4aus3), one reason why millennial are naturally YIMBY types is that we have had to move around for work and school so change is nothing new to us. The idea of settling down seems less reasonable.
