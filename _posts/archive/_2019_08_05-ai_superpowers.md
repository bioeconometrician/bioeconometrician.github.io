=Zhongguancun - the Silicon Valley of CHina
=Seven Giants of the AI age: Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent. 

The west does not appreciate the cultural power AI now has in China. There was first China's Sputnik Moment.

> AlphaGo scored its first high-profile victory in March 2016 during a five-game series against the legendary Korean player Lee Sedol, winning four to one. While barely noticed by most AMericans, the five games drew more than 280 million Chinese viewers. Overnight China plunged into an artificial intelligence fever. The buzz didn't quite rival America's reaction to Sputni,, but it lit a fire under the Chinese technology community that has been burning ever since.

Then there was the blessing the the CPC. After this speech, Kai-Fu says that normally conservative Chinese parents who grew up with the [iron rice bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_rice_bowl) mentality now wanted their sons and daughters to be part of "mass innovation". 

> On September 10, 2014, Premier Li Keqiang took the stage during the 2014 World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos" in the coastal Chinese city of Tianjin. THere he spoke of the crucial role technological innovation played in generating growth ad modernizing the Chinese economy. The speech was long an dense heavy on jargon and light on specifics. But of note during the speech, Li repeated a phrase that was new to the Chinese political lexicon: "mass entrepreneurship and mass innovation". ... Li's speech lit the first spark of what would become a raging fire in the Chinese technology industry, pushing activity in the investment and startup space to feverish new heights.

Kai-Fu thinks we're living in an **age of implementation**, where 1000 very good ML engineers are better than having the 10 best ML engineers. Not all technological races are like this. In the atomic weapons race adding Enrico Fermi to the Manhattan project was more valuable than 1K other less talented nuclear physics. Ditto for code breaking. 

> Core to the mistaken belief that the United States holds a major in AI is the impression that we are living in an age of discovery, a time in which elite AI researchers are constantly breaking down old paradigms and finally cracking longstanding mysteries. This impression has been fed by a constant stream of breathless media reports announcing the latest feat performed by AI... I believe this impression is misleading. Many of these new milestones are, rather, merely the application of the past decade's breakthroughs -- primarily deep learning but also complementary technology like reinforcement leaning and transfer learning -- to new problems. ... But making that distinction between discovery and implementation is core to understanding how AI will our lives and what -- or which country -- will primarily drive that progress. 

Andrew Ng's comment that [AI is the new electricity](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/andrew-ng-why-ai-new-electricity) is especially apt in that the fundamental technological breakthroughs have been obtained, and now what remains to do is light up the cities. 

> Mass electrification exemplified this process. Following Thomas Edison's harnessing of electricity, the field rapidly shifted from invention to implementation. Thousands of engineers began tinkering with electricity, using it to power new devices and reorganize industrial processes. Those tinkerers didn't have to break new ground like Edison. They just had to know enough about how electricity worked to turn its power into useful and profitable machines. 

Kai-Fu rightly points out several ingredients to AI supremacy that China has: data and large domestic internet firms with large use bases. But crucially there is no mention in Lee's book about why China has such a data advantage (after all India has lots of people): privacy rights are non-existent and the rule of law does not exist and the PRC wants companies to keep track of its citizens for it. Especially ironic is Lee's failure to note why there are *only* Chinese tech firms in the local ecosystem: foreign players refused to adhere to the PRC's remands they release information about their uses -- especially as he is the former president of Google China!

One reason that American business assumes China will never win in the AI race as their firms are too focused on copy-cat business models -- something which is culturally frowned upon in the Valley. But in an age of AI implementation the goal is to endlessly tinker with products on the margin, continually adding data, borrowing the best architectures to squeeze out a little more performance. 

Sometimes Lee has these slip-ups where he says things in a non-chalant manner that point to a more controversial political issue:

> But what if we in China could speed up that process by brute-forcing the geographic proximity? We could pick one street in Zongguancun, **clear out all the old inhabitants**, and open the space to key players in this kind of ecosystem. 

Lee points out that the Chinese governments has no qualms with burning through billions of dollars to jump-start the AI industry in China. Even if it builds many bridges-to-nowhere, what matters to the CPC is that there are at least some bridges. In contrast to the PRC, in the US, government support to startup industries is politically toxic due to the public's inability to tolerate losses on firms like [Solyndra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solyndra).

Kai-Fu decomposes AI into four key avenues: Internet AI, Business AI, Perception AI, and Autonomous AI. While the US is ahead of China currently in all categories except Perception AI (think facial recognition software), he sees only business AI as an area where the US will maintain dominance. China's tailwinds for AI progress will push them ahead in the other areas.  

Lee dedicates a whole chapter to the labour market impacts of AI. He is more on page with economists that say significant job losses are possible, but he identifies a four-quadrant framework to think about the sectors more likely to be hit first. For cognitive labour, there are two dimensions: on the x-axis there is optimization based work on the left, and creative/strategy-based work on the right. on the y-axis there is social work going up, and asocial work going down. (1,1) Safe Zone: CEO, psychiatrist, social worker, (-1,1) Human Veneer: Teacher, Tour guide, Doctor, (-1,-1): Danger zone: radiologist, translator, load underwrite, (1,-1) Slow creep: columnist, scientist, legal analyst.
