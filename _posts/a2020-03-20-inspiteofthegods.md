In Spite of the Gods: as in, we all know Inida is a uniquely "spiritual" country, being the birthplace of Hinduism, Sikhism, and Jainism. Luce is not interested in interested in the secular aspects of India.

> On arriving at Harvard University in the late 1980s, Dr. Sen found that every single book on India in the famous 'Harvard Coop' bookstore was kept in the section called 'Religions'.
>
> In short, a spirit of romance continues to guide the perceptions both of outsiders and of many Indians themselves. Indeed, so deeply embedded is other-worldliness in our conventional images, symbols and vocabulary of India that those who consciously reject it are sometimes its unwitting promoters.

Luce indexes India's modern development to the ideals and philosophies of three great men: Gandhi, Nehru, and Ambedkar. The influence of Ambedkar on India's modern history cannot be overstated by most foreigners are completely oblivious of his existence. 

> Ambedkar's view of the village stemmed from his own experience, in which the humiliations he suffered as a child, when barbers refused to cut his hair and wayside cafÃ©s denied him entrance, were only partially assuaged by the opportunities that an education in Bombay provided him... 'The love of the intellectual Indian for the village community is of course infinite, if not pathetic... What is the village but a sink of localism, a den of ignorance, narrow mindedness and communalism.'

> Indian nationalism has evolved considerably since Gandhi elevated non-violence and non-cooperation into a badge of identity for this emerging nation. Gandhi would surely not have been pleased to discover that India has nuclear weapons or that its missiles are named after ancient Hindu gods -- for example, Agni is the Vedic god of fire. But in spite of this, today's India would not be unrecognisable to Gandhi. Nor would it be unrecognisable to Ambedkar or Nehru.

### Nehru

Jawaharlal Nehru, and later Indira Gandhi, were instrumental in setting the rotten foundations for India's lacklustre economic growth rate (historically, and inappropriately, referred to as the "Hindu Rate of Growth"). As William Easterly points out in his book *The Illusive Quest for Growth*, development economics and like-minded leaders tended to view development as a problem of escaping some gravitational force of poverty by a sufficient acceleration of capital.

> The Indian farmer needed local irrigration projects to help insulate him against the vagaries of India's wildly erratic annual monsoon. Instead, Nehru unveiled grand dams, most of which are now crumbling and some of which were never completed. The average Indian also needed to learn how to read and write and have access to antibiotics and anti-malaria drugs, without which it was virtually impossible to escape poverty. Instead, Nehru's Congress governments poured resources into universities for the urban middle classes and into new public hospitals in the cities.

The dam building initiatives remind me of Nkrumah's disastrous attempts at turning a completely rural economy into a high-capital modern nation. To paraphrase Tolstoy, all poor countries are ruined alike, but rich countries find prosperity in their own way. Luce points that while even in hindsight it is clear that it was a futile waste of Indian's scarce resources to turn an economy with 80% agricultural employment into an industrial powerhouse within a decade, voices at the time were sceptical. However they were "drowned in a sea of utopian rectitude."

> The disparity between the Indian policy elite's dreams for tomorrow and what most Indians needed today was stark.

THIS IS STILL TRUE TODAY. SEE TABAROK'S ARTICLE ON POLICY IMITATION

### Caste

> The ancient laws of Manu, which set down caste duties in detail, teach that each caste must rigidly sick to its own dharma: 'It is better to do one's own duty badly than another man's well.'

Such an attitude is particularly ill-suited to the modern economy and urban society. 

> Expanding this system is the only serious item on the agenda of the lower-caste parties. None of them publishes manifestos at election times setting out policies on the economy, foreign policy or defence. All they offer their supporters is the ability to extract greater powers of patronage from the larger parties in exchange for making up the parliamentary numbers in multiparty coalitions.

Hence the lower case parties like Lalu of Yadav are interested in securing cabinet positions for the Ministry of Railways which employs 1.5 million people where patronage opportunities abounds. The Foreign Ministry holds little appeal in contrast. 

### Cancel culture

BJP draws its intellectual sustenance from the RSS. This movement shows interesting parallels to today's "new ideology" movement (a.k.a political correctness/wokeness/cancel culture).

> Romila Thapar, probably India's best-known classical historian, was subjected to very personal hate campaigns by the RSS. Expatriate eIndians belonging to American chapters of the RSS tried to present Thapar from speaking in public during her year in the United States as a visiting scholar. 

This case of Hindu Nationalism is yet another reason why "cancel culture" on university campuses needs to be brought to heel. It will inevitably be used "minority" interest groups to prevent discussion about their own crimes. Whether its Hindus feeling "threatened" by Islamic attacks on their history of Turks feeling "victimized" by discussions about the Armenian genocide, it is clearly a road to intellectual debasement. 

I've already mentioned before that the BJP has re-written the history textbooks on completely confabulated grounds, including strange claims about the Aryan-Harappan theory that the Indus valley is the original of Aryan civilization.
