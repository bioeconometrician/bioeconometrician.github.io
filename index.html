<h1> About me </h1>

<p> This blog is an informal complement to its technical <a href="http://erikdrysdale.com">counterpart</a> and is mainly composed of book reviews. My interests are fairly broad but tend to cluster around topics like history, politics, science, statistics, as well as some select fiction and poetry.</p>

<p> You can reach me here: <a href="mailto:13ewd@queensu.ca">13ewd@queensu.ca</a></p>
